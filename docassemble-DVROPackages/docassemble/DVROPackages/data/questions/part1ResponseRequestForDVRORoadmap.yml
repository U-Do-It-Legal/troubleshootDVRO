question: |
  Were You Served with a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)?
subquestion: |
  Along with the Request for a Domestic Violence Restraining Order ([form DV-100](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv100.pdf)) and its attachments, you might have also received a Temporary Restraining Order ([form DV-110](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv110.pdf)). This order provides immediate, temporary protections for the petitioner (aka., the protected party) until the court hearing. 
fields: 
  - Were you served with (given) a Temporary Restraining Order ([form DV-110](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv110.pdf))?: tro_granted
    datatype: yesnoradio
    help: |
      If a TRO was issued against you, there are specific temporary restrictions you must follow. Please check the documents you were served with (given) and indicate whether you received a DV-110 (TRO) in addition to the DV-100.
  - note: |
      ${card_start("Important Warning:", color="warning")}
      The answer to this question significantly impacts the guidance and information you'll receive throughout this interview. Please double-check the documents you've been served with to ensure you've answered this question correctly before proceeding.
      ${card_end()}

question: |
  **Warning:** Your Time-Sensitive Deadlines
subquestion: |
  The upcoming pages will outline how to find the key deadlines for your case.

  It's crucial to note these dates in a place you frequently reference, such as a calendar, to ensure you don't overlook or miss any vital court deadlines.
continue button field: deadlines_intro
---
question: |
  **Warning:** Your Time-Sensitive Deadlines
subquestion: |
  ${card_start("File Your Response by Your Hearing Date:", color="warning")}
  Your Response paperwork needs to be completed and submitted (filed with the court) before your scheduled hearing date.  
  ${card_end()}
  
  You can find the details of your hearing's date, time, and location in Item 3 on the Notice of Court  Hearing, form DV-109 (see below), which is part of the paperwork the other party had served on (given to) you. 
  
  ${prog_disclose(hearing_date_screenshot_template)}
  
  **Write down your hearing's date, time, and location somewhere important so you don't forget it or miss any deadlines.** 
  
  It is essential to both file a Response and attend the scheduled hearing if you want the court to consider your side of the story. Taking no action may cost you enormously.

question: |
  **Warning:** Your Time-Sensitive Deadlines
subquestion: |
  ${card_start("Need more time to prepare your Response? Request a Continuance:", color="warning")}
  In California DVRO cases, if you need additional time to prepare your Response, you have the right as a Respondent to request a one-time continuance, which is essentially a postponement of your hearing. 
  ${card_end()}
  
  Keep in mind, the court is authorized to grant such postponement requests when there's a demonstrated "good cause" by either party. 
  
  To ask the court to reschedule your hearing, you can access the optional **Part 3.1: Request to Reschedule Hearing** interview at any time on your membership homepage, which is designed to help you complete the Request to Continue Hearing (form DV-115) and a proposed Order on Request to Continue Court Hearing (form DV-116).

subquestion: |
  #####Mandatory Firearms Restrictions and Receipts:
  
  You indicated on a prior page that you were served with a Temporary Restraining Order (form DV-110). Because there was a TRO issued against you, you are prohibited from owning, using, or possessing firearms (guns), firearms parts (receiver, frame, or unfinished receiver or frame as defined in [Penal Code section 16531](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=16531.)), or ammunition until your hearing date, during which the judge will decide whether to make the firearms restrictions permanent. 
  
  You must keep track of the following firearms restrictions deadlines, which will each be explained on the following pages:
  
  - Your 24-Hour Deadline,
  - Your 48-Hour Deadline, and
  - The Hearing on Firearms Restrictions

subquestion: |
  #####How Do I Comply with the Firearms Restrictions in the Temporary Restraining Order?
  
  To assist individuals in understanding and adhering to the firearms restrictions associated with a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), the court has prepared a comprehensive guide. 
  
  This court form, titled "How Do I Turn In, Sell, or Store My Firearms, Firearm Parts, and Ammunition?" ([form DV-800-INFO/JV-270-INFO](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv800info.pdf)), provides all the necessary details and steps you should take to ensure compliance with he firearms restrictions. 
  
  We highly recommend that you click the blue hyperlink above to review this form and gain a clear understanding of your obligations. Note, a copy of the form will be available to download at the end of this interview.

  **Warning:** Write Down Your Time-Sensitive Deadlines
subquestion: |
  #####Consequences of Not Complying with Firearms Restrictions:

  Adhering to the firearms restrictions outlined in a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) is not just a matter of legal obligation; it's a matter of serious consequence if ignored. If you fail to comply with these restrictions, here's what you could face:

  - **Law Enforcement Notification:** The court may notify law enforcement agencies about your non-compliance. This could lead to immediate action, including a search of your premises or further legal repercussions.
  - **Prosecution:** Violation of the TRO's firearms restrictions can be seen as contempt of court or even a separate crime. The court has the authority to notify a prosecuting attorney, which might result in criminal charges against you and your arrest.
  - **Increased Scrutiny:** Non-compliance can impact the court's perception of you, possibly affecting other decisions in your DVRO case or future legal proceedings.
  
  It's crucial to understand that obeying these restrictions is not only about adhering to a court order but also about safeguarding your legal standing and future. It's always advisable to follow the order meticulously and seek guidance if you're unsure about any aspect of compliance.

question: |
  **Warning:** Write Down Your Time-Sensitive Deadlines
subquestion: |
  #####What if I Feel a TRO Was Granted Against Me Unjustly?
  
  If you believe that a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) was issued against you unfairly, it's crucial to understand that the TRO is only enforceable until the court hearing. At this hearing, you will have the opportunity to contest the other party's request for a permanent Domestic Violence Restraining Order. If the judge decides not to grant a permanent order, the restrictions on firearms will be lifted.
  
  Given this, if you're confident about your case's merits and foresee a positive outcome, you might consider temporarily storing your firearms with a licensed dealer or law enforcement rather than selling them. This way, if the TRO is lifted, you can retrieve your items without incurring a permanent loss. 
  
  **However, always ensure you strictly comply with the temporary restrictions while the TRO is in effect.**

question: |
  **Warning:** Pause and Exit This Interview if Approaching the 24-Hour or the 48-Hour Deadlines
subquestion: |
  If your 24-hour deadline to turn in, sell, or store your firearms is approaching or has passed OR if your 48-hour deadline to provide a receipt of your forfeiture or sale of firearms is your possession is approaching or has passed, **exit this interview now and begin the "Part 2.3, Firearms Restrictions" interview found on your membership homepage**. 
  
  Don't worry; your current progress will be saved, allowing you to resume this interview later.

question: |
  Important Note on Interview Order
subquestion: |
  You have completed the section outlining how to locate important deadlines in your case. Keep tabs on these deadlines to protect your standing, rights, and obligations in the case. 
  
  Remember, your progress on each interview is saved automatically, so you may complete the interviews in the order necessary to meet your deadlines. 
  
  % if tro_granted and has_firearms:
  For example, if facing a fast-approaching 48-hour firearms restriction deadline, prioritize interview **Part 2.3: Firearms Restrictions**. Alternatively, if your hearing is approaching and you need more preparation time, begin with interview **Part 3.1: Request for Continuance** before tackling other interviews.
  % else:
  For instance, if your hearing date is soon and you require more time to complete the interviews that prepare your Response court forms and documents, you should prioritize completing the **Part 3.1: Request for Continuance** interview before proceeding with others.

  DVRO Cases from Start to Finish
subquestion: |
  The upcoming pages offer a comprehensive breakdown of the DVRO case process from beginning to end. Here's an overview of the steps you'll learn about:

  1. The Petitioner (the other party) submits a Request for a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO). The judge then determines if a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) should be issued.

  2. You receive the Petitioner's Request for DVRO, and if issued, the TRO.

  3. As the Respondent (that's you), you file a Response. This document outlines your perspective and any orders you're seeking.

  4. Both sides attend one or more court hearings. At these hearings, the judge decides on the issuance of a Permanent Restraining Order (DVRO/ROAH).

  5. Important Info: Enforcing and Modifying Restraining Orders.

  6. Important Info: Understanding Mutual Restraining Orders.

  #####**Step 1:** The Other Party Files a Request for DVRO
  
  When someone files a request for a restraining order, he or she must prepare the necessary court forms and submit them to the court. The person who initiates the case by filing the Request for DVRO is called the "Petitioner," and the person who responds to this request (in this case, you) is called the "Respondent."  
  
  "Filing" refers to the act of submitting these court forms and documents to the court, typically through the court clerk's office. It's the initial step the Petitioner takes to request a restraining order against you. The Petitioner's court forms and documents will contain the orders they want, as well as their allegations against you. We will help you understand the Petitioner's court forms and documents in your next interview. 

  After the Petitioner has submitted their initial paperwork, the court clerk will pass all their court forms and documents to the judge. The judge then reviews these materials and decides if there is enough evidence to issue a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against you. By law, the judge must decide by the next business day, but the specific timing can vary from one court to another.

  Understanding Temporary Restraining Orders (TRO) 
subquestion: |
  **What is a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)?**

  A Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) is a short-term protective order issued by the court. Its purpose is to offer immediate safety to the Petitioner. Once the order is granted, the Petitioner is often referred to as the "Protected Party." The order places specific conditions on the Respondent, who, once the TRO is in effect, is commonly called the "Restrained Party."

  **Key Features of a TRO:**

subject: |
  Duration
content: |
  **Duration:** A TRO is, by nature, temporary. It typically lasts for a few weeks, up to a maximum of 25 days, or until a full court hearing takes place to determine whether a "permanent" order (a DVRO/ROAH) should be issued.

template: tro_notice
subject: |
  Issued Without Notice to You
content: |
  **Issued Without Notice:** In situations where the Petitioner provides enough evidence to convince the judge that they're in immediate danger or that notifying you in advance would jeopardize their safety, a TRO can be issued without you being informed first. This is called an "ex parte" order.

  DVRO Cases from Start to Finish
subquestion: |
  #####**Step 2: You're Served with the Request for DVRO (and TRO, if one was issued)**
  
  After the Petitioner files the Request for DVRO, they are required to ensure you are formally "served" with the court forms and documents they've submitted.

  In legal terms, "service" means the official delivery of legal documents to another party in a case. This process ensures that everyone involved is aware of court actions and gives the Respondent (in this case, you) the opportunity to respond with your side of the story. Think of it as a court's official way of making sure you're informed about the case's progress.

  It's crucial to thoroughly review any documents you receive to understand the Petitioner's specific claims or allegations. And remember, we're here to assist you in navigating these documents in the upcoming interview.

  DVRO Cases from Start to Finish
subquestion: |
  #####**Step 3: You File a Response**
  
  Once you have been served with the Request for DVRO (and TRO, if one was issued), you can file a document known as the "Response" to present your side of the story. In this document, you can agree with or disagree with the orders requested by the person seeking protection (the Petitioner), and can also request orders of your own. For instance, you might ask for child visitation rights or a change in the proposed contact restrictions. 
  
  Further, as the Respondent, you have a special right to ask the court to postpone (or "continue") the hearing if you need more time to prepare your Response or find a lawyer to prepare your case. Remember, just like the Petitioner, your requests are not automatically granted. The judge will carefully consider all the information and make a decision at the hearing.
  
  **Serving the Response Onto the Petitioner**

  Once you've filed your Response and any associated documents with the court, it's crucial that the Petitioner is formally "served" with your court forms and documents. To reiterate, "service" in legal terms refers to the official delivery of documents to another party involved in a case. The purpose of this service is to inform the Petitioner of your Response and to offer them an opportunity to address your claims at the upcoming hearing, much like how you were informed of their initial request. We'll provide you with specific instructions for Service in the **Part 3, Next Steps** interview.

  #####**Step 4: Court Hearing**
  
  While you might wish that everything could be decided in one hearing, it is important to know that the court's priority is making fair and informed decisions. This sometimes means multiple hearings are needed to fully address all the issues of a particular request. However, the exact number of hearings can vary widely depending on the specifics of the case.
  
  ${prog_disclose(multiple_hearings_explanation)}
  
  The court may also postpose (continue) your hearing if:
 
  - You have not been served or you need time to get a lawyer or prepare a Response, 
  - The judge wants more information, or 
  - Your hearing is taking longer than planned.

  Understanding Your Employment Protections: What Employment Rights Exist for Domestic Violence Victims in California?
content: |
  **Domestic Violence Victim Leave**
  
  [California Labor Code section 230](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=230.&lawCode=LAB) provides important employment protections for victims of domestic violence. If you believe that you are a victim of domestic violence and if you work for an employer with **more than 25 employees**, you have the right to take domestic violence victim leave. This allows you time off work to address various matters related to the domestic violence, such as:
  
  - obtaining temporary restraining orders, 
  - seeking medical or mental health treatment, or 
  - finding safety in a domestic violence shelter.

  **Notifying the Employer** 
  
  To exercise your right to domestic violence leave, you need to notify your employer within a reasonable time of your intended leave, unless advance notice is not feasible. 
  
  **Right to Reasonable Accommodation**
  
  Once you provide notice, your employer is required to provide "reasonable accommodation" during your time off. This can include:
  
  - changing your work schedule, 
  - installing locks on your door, 
  - changing work telephone numbers, 
  - transferring you to a different job or location, or 
  - implementing other changes that help protect your safety at work.

  **No Retaliation or Discrimination**
  
  It's important to note that your employer is prohibited from retaliating against you or treating you differently as a result of taking domestic violence leave. They cannot wrongfully terminate your employment, fail to promote you, harass you, or discriminate against you based on your leave.

  If you believe your employer has violated these protections, you can file a complaint with the California Labor Commissioner's Office. Employment attorneys experienced in this area can guide you through the process and help protect your rights.

  Why might the court need to hold multiple hearings?
content: |
  In a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) case, the court may need to hold multiple hearings if certain additional orders are requested, such as child custody, visitation, or support orders.

  Here's why: these orders involve complex issues that often require more detailed investigation and consideration. For instance, if you or the other party request child custody or visitation orders, the court needs to ensure that any decisions made are in the best interests of the child or children. This often involves considering documentary evidence, hearing testimony from both parties and others, and sometimes, obtaining reports from child welfare professionals.

  Similarly, decisions on child support or spousal support orders involve reviewing the financial circumstances of both parties. The court needs to ensure that any order made is fair and in line with California's guidelines for support and applicable law.

question: |
  **Important Information:** Enforcement and Modification
subquestion: |
  **Restraining Order Enforcement**
  
  If the court issues a permanent restraining order against you after the hearing, it's vital to familiarize yourself with and follow all the directives stated in the Restraining Order After Hearing ([form DV-130](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv130.pdf)).

  Additionally, the Judicial Council of California has provided a concise, 2-page guide on the enforcement of restraining orders in the state. You can access it [here](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv530info.pdf). Even though this document is primarily aimed at the protected party (Petitioner), we strongly suggest that you, as the hypothetical restrained party (Respondent) in this scenario, review it. This ensures you fully understand your legal responsibilities concerning the restraining order.
  
  **Restraining Order Modification**

  Sometimes, circumstances change, and you may want to modify (change) the terms of the restraining order. The Judicial Council of California has created a helpful, 4-page guide on how to change or end a restraining order after your hearing through the Request for Order process, available [here](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv400info.pdf). Currently, U Do It Legal does not offer Request for Order services. However, we plan to introduce this service in 2024.

  **Understanding Your Rights in DVRO Cases**

  Being named as the Respondent in a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) case can be daunting. However, it's essential to know that even if you're the Respondent accused of abusing the other party, you still have the right to file your own DVRO request if you believe you've been a victim of domestic violence.
  
  The legal system recognizes that complex situations can arise where both parties feel threatened. As you navigate this journey, remain informed and genuine in your actions, keeping in mind that the court aims to ensure the safety and well-being of all parties involved.

question: |
  **Important Information:** Mutual Restraining Orders
subquestion: |
  **When Both Parties Request DVROs: What Happens in Court**

  If both parties file requests for Domestic Violence Restraining Orders (DVROs) against each other, it's known as "cross-filing" or "mutual requests." Here's what typically happens in such cases:

  - **Separate Hearings:** Initially, the court may set separate hearings for each DVRO request. This ensures that each party has an individual opportunity to present their case.
  - **Consolidation:** In some instances, a judge might decide to consolidate the hearings, meaning both requests are addressed in a single hearing. This can make the process more efficient and allow the judge to get a holistic view of the situation.
  - **Evidence Presentation:** Each party will be given a chance to present evidence and witnesses to support their claims of domestic violence. This could include photos, medical records, text messages, or testimonies.
  - **Legal Representation:** Even if you're representing yourself, remember that the other party might have legal representation. It's beneficial to be prepared, understand your rights, and, if possible, consider seeking legal advice or representation.
  - **Decision:** After considering all the evidence and hearing from both parties, the judge will decide whether to grant one, both, or neither of the DVRO requests. It's possible for both parties to be granted restraining orders against each other if the judge believes both have valid claims of abuse.
  - **Consequences:** If a DVRO is granted, it typically comes with specific conditions, such as prohibiting contact between the parties or requiring one party to move out of a shared residence. It's crucial to understand and adhere to these conditions to avoid legal consequences.

  Additional Considerations to Keep in Mind: Cost
subquestion: |
  #####**Cost**
  
  Understanding what the legal process can and might cost is crucial, especially when representing yourself in a DVRO case in California. While the goal is to ensure all parties' safety and well-being, it is also important to plan for the potential costs involved.
  
  Below, we break down some of the common and potential costs you might incur in a DVRO case, from waived filing fees to service fees, and even considerations like time off work or childcare. Remember, each case is unique, and actual costs can vary based on individual circumstances.

  Filing Fees
content: |
  In a DVRO case, you will not typically have to worry about filing fees. California law waives these fees for individuals seeking or responding to a Domestic Violence Restraining Order, recognizing the urgent need for these protections. In other words, you should not have to pay to file your Response in a California Domestic Violence Restraining Order case. 
---
template: process_server_fees
subject: |
  Service Fees
content: |
  Serving your response paperwork is a crucial step in the legal process, ensuring that the petitioner receives the official documents detailing your side of the story. You have several options for serving these documents:

  **Personal Service:**

  - Friend or Family Member: You can ask someone you know, who is over 18 and not involved in the case, to serve the papers. This option is typically free. However, the person serving the court paperwork must be present at the hearing to inform the judge of the service details.
  - Professional Process Server: You may hire a professional to deliver the papers on your behalf. This method incurs a fee, which can vary based on the service provider.

  **Service by Mail:**

  This method involves mailing the response documents directly to the petitioner. It's essential to send them using a method that provides a proof of delivery, such as certified mail with return receipt. This proof can be crucial as evidence that the petitioner received the documents. Remember to keep a copy of all paperwork sent and any delivery confirmations you receive.
  
  Note: We will provide you with thorough instructions for service in the **Part 3, Next Steps** interview.

  While you’ve chosen to represent yourself in this case using U Do It Legal, be mindful that the other party in the case might hire an attorney. In some circumstances, the court may order one party to pay all or a portion of the other party’s attorney’s fees. Attorney's fees are generally awarded only to the party that “prevails” in (i.e., wins) the case, with the court also taking into consideration the difference in income or financial resources between the two parties.

question: |
  Additional Considerations to Keep in Mind: Conflict Level
subquestion: |
  #####**Conflict Level**
  
  DVRO cases can vary greatly in terms of conflict levels, ranging from relatively amicable situations where both parties agree on most issues, to highly contentious circumstances where almost every aspect of the case is disputed. 
  
  Navigating these conflict levels while self-representing can be challenging, but understanding what to expect can help prepare you for the journey ahead. We explore the different types of conflict you may encounter during your DVRO case below. Each scenario is unique and will require a different approach.
  
  ${prog_disclose(low_conflict)}
  ${prog_disclose(medium_conflict)}
  ${prog_disclose(high_conflict)}
  ${prog_disclose(unknown_conflict)}
  
  Remember, navigating a DVRO case can be complicated and emotionally draining. No matter the level of conflict, ensure that your physical safety and emotional well-being are prioritized. Reach out for support when necessary and stay informed about your rights and options.

template: low_conflict
subject: |
  Low Conflict
content: |
  **Low Conflict:** In some DVRO cases, the situation may be relatively low conflict. This typically happens if the Respondent (you) agrees to the orders made and is willing to adhere to the orders imposed by the court. If you agree with the requests filed by the petitioner, you can reduce the need for contentious hearings or ongoing legal battles. However, even in low conflict situations, it’s important to remain vigilant and prepared. Unexpected situations may arise, so maintaining open communication with the court is crucial.
---
template: medium_conflict
subject: |
  Medium Conflict
content: |
  **Medium Conflict:**  In medium conflict situations, the Respondent (you) might partially agree with some of the requests filed, but dispute others. These scenarios often require more negotiation when attempting settlement, and may result in multiple court appearances. Remember that every detail you provide—evidence of abuse, records of interactions, pictures, etc.—can influence the judge’s decisions. Be prepared to substantiate your claims and stand your ground in these situations.
---
template: high_conflict
subject: |
  High Conflict
content: |
  **High Conflict:** In high conflict situations, the Respondent (you) may resist all requested orders, any restraining order issued, deny allegations, or even file their own Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order against the other party. These cases can be extremely stressful and may involve prolonged court battles. Legal counsel or advice from a lawyer can be particularly beneficial in these instances. U Do It Legal urges individuals to hire an attorney rather than relying solely on our services in these situations. Always prioritize your safety; if you fear escalation or violent reactions from the other party, consider also seeking assistance from law enforcement or a domestic violence hotline. The court can also potentially assist in enforcing any protective order issued to you, and otherwise aiding you in your safety.

  Unknown Conflict Level
content: |
  **Unknown Conflict Level:** In some cases, the level of conflict may be unpredictable. The each party's reactions might vary, and they may become more confrontational over time. In these cases, be prepared for any eventuality. Courts recommend keeping records of all interactions between you and the other party. Don’t hesitate to seek professional advice or assistance from local law enforcement, local resources, and organizations when needed.

  **Criminal Protective Order** (CPO)
content: |
  **Purpose:**

  A Criminal Protective Order (CPO) is a court order that protects a victim of a crime, including domestic violence, from the person who committed the crime, often referred to as the “defendant” or “other party.” In cases where the defendant is charged with a crime related to domestic violence by the District Attorney, the CPO is issued to protect the victim from further abuse and to ensure the victim’s safety during the criminal proceedings.
  
  **Issuance:**
  
  A CPO is issued by a criminal court judge at the defendant’s arraignment or at any point during the criminal proceedings if the judge believes it is necessary to protect the victim. A CPO can also be issued in conjunction with a criminal protective order petition filed by the victim with the court.
  
  **Duration:**

  A CPO can be issued for the duration of the criminal proceedings and, if the defendant is convicted of the crime, the order can remain in effect for up to 10 years.

  **Availability:**

  A CPO can only be issued in connection with a criminal case and is not a substitute for a DVRO. If a victim of domestic violence wants protection beyond the duration of the criminal proceedings, they will need to file a petition for a DVRO with the family court.

  **Notice:**

  The other party is notified of the CPO at the time of their arraignment or when the order is issued, and the order is enforceable by law enforcement.

  ${card_start("Note:", color="light")}
  A CPO is separate from a DVRO and is issued in a criminal court, while a DVRO is issued in civil/family court. U Do It Legal does not handle or assist with CPOs or criminal matters.

  **Purpose:** 

  An EPO is issued to provide immediate, short-term protection from domestic violence, stalking, or other forms of abuse.

  **Issuance:**

  Upon the request of a law enforcement (police) officer, EPOs can be issued by a judge. EPOs are typically issued when the officer believes someone is in immediate danger and needs protection.

  **Duration:**

  An EPO is valid for a brief period, usually up to 7 days.

  **Availability:** 

  EPOs can be issued 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and can be obtained without the person seeking protection appearing in court.

  **Notice:**

  The person being restrained does not need to be present or notified before the EPO is issued.
  
  ${card_start("Note", color="info")}
  Law enforcement officers (police) must initiate the issuance of an EPO by a judge. Because of this, U Do It Legal does not handle or assist with EPOs. However, we do help people navigate the TRO and DVRO/ROAH processes described in the info boxes above.

template: tro_explanation
subject: |
  **Temporary Restraining Order** (TRO)
content: |
  **Purpose:**

  A temporary restraining order, or TRO, is issued to provide short-term protection from abuse or harassment defined under the law until a court hearing can take place to decide whether a permanent longer-term restraining order is necessary.

  More specifically, a TRO is an order for one person to temporarily stay away from another person, including their home, vehicle, work, and, if applicable, protected household or family members, if requested. If a TRO is granted, and if requested, the court can also order the abusive person to do things like move out of a shared residence, pay utility bills or child support, cease (stop) contact, and the like.

  Additionally: 

  - Anyone 12 and over can apply for a TRO without parental consent.
  - A TRO must be filed in civil/family court, not criminal court.
  
  **Issuance:**

  TROs are issued by a judge after a person seeking protection (the Petitioner) files a request in court. If granted, TROs are typically issued the same-day or the following day.

  **Duration:**

  A TRO typically lasts two to three weeks and is **only valid and enforceable until the date of the hearing.** A judge decides whether to issue a more permanent restraining order at the hearing.

  **Availability:**

  TROs can only be issued during court hours, and the Petitioner typically needs to appear in court to request one. California court hours vary from courthouse to courthouse, but are generally 8:30 AM to 4:30PM. For specific hours and department calendar schedules, visit your local Superior Court website for more information.

  **Domestic Violence Restraining Orders** (DVRO) / **Restraining Orders After Hearing** (ROAH) 
content: |
  **Purpose:**
   
  Like a TRO, a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) is a court order designed to protect victims of domestic violence victim from an abusive partner, a family member, or someone in their household. In California, we often call this order a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (also known as a “Restraining Order After Hearing, “ROAH”).   

  The DVRO/ROAH is a “permanent” restraining order issued by the court against the Respondent **after a hearing**. It may provide the same specific restrictions as a TRO, or impose greater restrictions, and is valid for a specified period of time.

  **Issuance:**

  DVROs/ROAHs are issued by a judge after the person seeking protection (the Petitioner) files a request in court, serves the opposing party (the Respondent), and attends the court set hearing. 

  **Duration:**

  If granted, a DVRO/ROAH can last up to 5 years, after which it can be renewed if necessary.

  **Availability:** 

  DVROs are issued during/after a hearing held during court hours. ROAHs are issued by a judge after the person seeking protection (the Petitioner) attends the DVRO hearing following service of the court documents on the opposing party.

  **Notice:**

  The Respondent must be served with a copy of the court papers and given an opportunity to file a Response before the DVRO/ROAH hearing.

  Physical Abuse
content: |
  California Family Code section 6203 defines "abuse" as it relates to Domestic Violence Restraining Orders. Physical abuse is included within the broader definition of "abuse" in this section. Family Code section 6203 states:

  (a) For purposes of this act, “abuse” means any of the following:

  - (1) To intentionally or recklessly cause or attempt to cause bodily injury.
  - (2) Sexual assault.
  - (3) To place a person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to that person or to another.
  - (4) To engage in any behavior that has been or could be enjoined pursuant to Section 6320.

  (b) Abuse is not limited to the actual infliction of physical injury or assault.

  This definition means that physical abuse, as it relates to DVROs, includes intentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury to another person. Bodily injury refers to any physical harm inflicted upon a person, such as cuts, bruises, or fractures.

  In the context of Domestic Violence Restraining Orders (DVROs), California Family Code section 6320 is particularly relevant when it comes to verbal and emotional abuse. While the Family Code does not explicitly define "verbal abuse" or "emotional abuse," it does include "disturbing the peace of the other party" as a form of behavior that can be restrained.

  "Disturb[ing] the peace of the other party" is defined under Family Code section 6320(c) as: 

  “...conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, destroys the mental or emotional calm of the other party. This conduct may be committed directly or indirectly, including through the use of a third party, and by any method or through any means including, but not limited to, telephone, online accounts, text messages, internet-connected devices, or other electronic technologies. This conduct includes, but is not limited to, **coercive control**, which is a pattern of behavior that in purpose or effect unreasonably interferes with a person’s free will and personal liberty."

  Sexual Abuse and Reproductive Coercion
content: |
  In the context of Domestic Violence Restraining Orders (DVROs), California Family Code section 6320 addresses various behaviors that can be restrained, including sexual assault.

  While the Family Code does not provide a specific definition of "sexual abuse" for the purpose of DVROs, it does refer to "sexually assaulting" as a behavior that can be restrained. Generally, sexual abuse can be understood as non-consensual sexual acts or behaviors, including, but not limited to, sexual assault, rape, or any form of unwanted sexual contact or coercion.

  Sexual assault is defined under California's Penal Code, specifically in sections 261-269. In California, the term "sexual assault" is often used interchangeably with "rape." According to Penal Code section 261, rape is defined as non-consensual sexual intercourse with a person accomplished by means of force, violence, duress, menace, fear, or fraud. The law also considers sexual intercourse without consent, when the victim is incapacitated or incapable of giving consent, as rape.

subject: |
  Stalking or Cyberstalking
content: |
  In the context of DVROs, restraining orders can be issued to protect victims from stalking and cyberstalking behaviors, as they are considered forms of abuse that disturb the peace of the other party. For example, California Family Code section 6320(a) includes "stalking" as a behavior that can be restrained.

  While the Family Code does not explicitly define "stalking" or "cyberstalking," they can be understood through California Penal Code section 646.9, which defines stalking as:

  "Any person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows or willfully and maliciously harasses another person and who makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for his or her safety, or the safety of his or her immediate family is guilty of the crime of stalking."

  California Penal Code section 646.9 was amended in the late 1990s by changing the definition of credible threats to include “electronically communicated threats.” While "cyberstalking" is a term that is not explicitly defined under California law, it is used more broadly to refer to stalking that occurs electronically, such as through emails, text messages, social media, or other online platforms.  It involves the same willful, malicious, and repeated behavior as stalking but occurs in the digital space.

  Self-Help centers are typically located within courthouses or nearby, offering free legal assistance to individuals like you who are representing themselves in legal matters.

  At a Self-Help Center, you can get guidance on understanding court procedures, preparing legal forms, and identifying other resources you might need for your case. You can also ask questions about the legal process and get assistance with paperwork. Like U Do It Legal, center staff cannot provide legal advice, but they can explain how the law works, help you understand your rights, direct you to resources and services that can further assist you, and review your completed court forms. 
  
  Note that Self-Help Centers vary greatly depending on which court and county you are in. Check your local court's website for more information on your local Self-Help Center's services and eligibility criteria.

  #####Important Time-Sensitive Reminders
  
  **File Your Response by Your Hearing Date:**
  
  Remember, you must complete and file your Response paperwork by your scheduled hearing date (see form DV-109, item 3 in the Petitioner's paperwork) if you want the court to hear your side of the story. Taking no action may cost you enormously. 
  
  **If You Need Moe Time, You Can Request A Continuance:**
  
  If you need more time, remember that you are entitled to one continuance (postponement), which you can request by completing interview Part 3.1: Request to Reschedule Hearing
  
  **Mandatory Firearms Restrictions and Receipts:**
  
  Additionally, if you were served with a Temporary Restraining Order (form DV-110) you are prohibited from owning, using, or possessing guns:
    
  - Within 24 hours of recieving a TRO or DVRO issued against you, you must sell to or store with a licensed gun dealer, or turn in to law enforcement, any prohibited items you have in your immediate possession or control. 
  - Within 48 hours of receiving a TRO or DVRO/ROAH issued against you, you must file a receipt with the court that proves all prohibited items have been turned in, sold, or stored. If law enforcement serves you with a restraining order, you must give a copy of the receipt to that law enforcement agency.
