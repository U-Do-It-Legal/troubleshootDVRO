  **DV-160,** Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential
content: |
  Form DV-160 is a document filed with the court to request that a minorâ€™s personal information, such as their name, address, and birthdate, be kept confidential in a domestic violence or family law case. This is done to protect the minorâ€™s privacy and safety. 
  
    A parent or guardian can complete and file this form with the court, typically alongside other related forms, such as DV-100, Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order, or DV-105, Request for Child Custody and Visitation Orders. The court will review the request and make a decision based on the best interest of the minor.
---
template: dv_165_explanation
subject: |
  **DV-165,** Order on Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential 
content: |
  Form DV-165 is a court order that, if the request is granted, mandates that the minor's personal information in domestic violence cases be kept confidential, safeguarding the identified children from potential harm or further harassment. It is issued in response to a filed DV-160, Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential.
  
  A judge reviews the DV-160 form and decides whether to grant or deny the request for confidentiality. If approved, the judge will issue the DV-165 order, providing that the minor's information remains confidential throughout the legal proceedings.
  
  Please note that we do not complete this form on your behalf. The official court order can only be prepared and issued by the judge/judicial officer assigned to your case. The judge/judicial officer will specify on this form which orders are granted or denied, any additional orders being made, and will sign the order form. However, our website will prepare a proposed order that you would like the judge to issue, which you can give to the court clerk alongside your DV-160. This proposed order helps streamline the process for the court in completing the form accurately.

question: |
  Before we begin,
subquestion: |
  Before you start answering questions, please have a copy of your completed DV-100 form (the Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order) and any other forms you intend to file with it, as they will help you through this interview. We recommend that you either print physical copies to have during this interview, or you have digital/electronic copies available on your device.

  In order to inform the court about the specific information you wish to keep confidential, you will need to refer to your completed DV-100 form and its attachments. Form DV-160, the Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential, provides two methods for indicating to the court the information you want kept confidential:

  1. Option one is to make a copy of your completed DV-100 and its attachments. Then, using blue or black ink, circle the information stated in the copy that you want confidential and attach that document to the back of your completed DV-160 form.
  2. Option two involves you stating in a separate document the information contained in DV-100 and its attachments that you want  confidential by identifying where that information is in DV-100 and what specific information you want redacted so that this information is confidential. Page 3, at subsection c (2) of DV-160 will populate the information you want confidential and where it is located in DV-100. 
  
  We also recommend that you review the Court's [informational sheet regarding Privacy Protections for Minors](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv160info.pdf) before beginning this interview. That information sheet provides a very good summary of this process.

content: |
  [California Government Code section 6206](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home/laws/confidential-address-program-victims-domestic-violence-sexual-assault-and-stalking-program-law) states that if a party (or his or her children) alleges to be a victim of domestic violence or abuse at the hands of the opposing party, that the victim and his or her children's current address may remain confidential if unknown to the other party. 
  
  The Court requires that you include an address on your forms where you can receive mail regarding the case you are filing, such as a friend or relative's address or P.O. box. **This address does not have to be the place where you live.** Court documents and court files are public record and whatever address is included on your forms will be seen by the other party and anyone else who looks at the Court file. 
  
  ${card_start("Note:", color="info")}
  If you are able to receive mail from your home, you may write down your residential address even if you have left the home due to the abuse you claim, and you intend to return to and live at the home and have ${ resp.name.first } removed.

  Information to Be Kept Confidential From the Public
subquestion: |

  If information relating to the minor is ordered confidential by the court, the public will not have access to this information through public court records. However, note that the Other Party must be given the information that is necessary to comply with the restraining order and to respond to the restraining order request. Also, the court may permit to the release of certain confidential information in this case to other people like the minor's childcare provider or school, or anyone who needs the information to protect the minor's best interest or to prevent abuse.

  Family Code section 6301.5: What circumstances must the judge consider when deciding to grant or deny a request to keep infomration about a minor confidential?
content: |
  [Family Code section 6301.5](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=6301.5.&lawCode=FAM) states, "To approve your request, the court must expressly find all of the following: 
  
  - The minor's right to privacy overcomes the public's right to access the information;
  - There's a substantial probability that the minor's interest will be prejudiced if the information is not kept confidential;
  - The order to keep the information confidential is narrowly tailored; and
  - No less restrictive means exist to protect the minor's privacy."
  
  ${prog_disclose(famcode_section_6301_5_simplified)}

template: famcode_section_6301_5_simplified
subject: |
  What does this mean in more simple terms?
content: |
  In a California DVRO case, when deciding whether to grant a request to keep a minor's information confidential, the court must be convinced of the following:

  - The minor's need for privacy is more important than the public's right to access the information.
  - If the information is not kept secret, it is very likely that the minor will be negatively affected.
  - The request to keep the information confidential is precisely focused and does not cover more information than necessary.
  - The way in which you are propopsing to protect the minor's privacy is the least intrusive of all other posible ways to keep that information confidential.

  If the court agrees that each of these conditions is satisfied by the request, then it may approve the request to keep the minor's information confidential.

question: |
  Read the page below before identifying the additional information you want kept kept confidential on the next pages.
subquestion: |
  #####**How does California Law define what information can be kept confidential?**
  
  In California, the laws pertaining to domestic violence restraining orders and child custody decisions are largely contained within the California Family Code and the California Rules of Court. The following identifies and provides a brief description of some key sections and rules:

  ${prog_disclose(judicial_considerations_explanation)}
  
  ${prog_disclose(ca_rulesofcourt_5_382)}
  
  ${prog_disclose(famcode_section_3048)}

  ${prog_disclose(famcode_section_6200)}

  These are the rules and codes generally applicable to a request for information about a minor to be confidential, but may not encompass all of the considerations by a judicial officer when granting or denying a request to keep minor's information confidential. Each case is unique and the judge will consider the facts and circumstances of each individual case in the manner he/she deems appropriate and in conformity with the law.

  How would you like to proceed?
subquestion: |
  **As a reminder:**
  
  Form DV-160, the Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential, provides two methods for indicating which additional information should be treated as confidential:

  1. Option one is to circle the information you want to keep confidential directly on a copy of your completed form(s), and then attach the copy(s) to the back of your DV-160 form.
  2. Option two involves referencing the information you want to keep confidential by providing specific details about each piece of information's location within the form(s). This can include mentioning the information's form number, page number, paragraph number, line number, attachment number, and/or exhibit number.
fields: 
  - note: "**Select the option you want to proceed with** (check one):"
  - I want to circle all the information I want kept confidential on a copy of form DV-100 and other forms that I am filing and then attach the copy(s) to the back of my DV-160 form.: circle_confidential_info
