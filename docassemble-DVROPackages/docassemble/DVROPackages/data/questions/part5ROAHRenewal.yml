  **Next Steps:** This Interview's Purpose
subquestion: |
  This interview provides guidance on what happens if the court grants you a "permanent" restraining order, which is often referred to as a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) or a Restraining Order After Hearing (ROAH). 
  
  Throughout the rest of this interview, we'll use the abbreviation ROAH to refer to these types of orders.

  Additionally, this interview walks you through the process of requesting a renewal for an ROAH if you decide to extend the orders beyond their initial expiration date, usually around 3 to 5 years after they were issued.

  ${card_start("Important Note:", color="info")}
  Please be aware that this interview is tailored for individuals who have been granted a ROAH. If your request for such an order was denied during your hearing, the information provided in this interview may not apply to your situation.

  @ RYAN, CLICK THIS -- What if the court denied my request for a "permanent" restraining order (ROAH)?
content: |
  RYAN ADD LANGUAGE WE DISCUSSED RE: ASSURANCES FOR USERS WHOSE REQUEST FOR A DVRO/ROAH WAS DENIED
  
  If your request for "permanent" restraining orders was denied, you may exit this interview and talk to an advocate about what you can do to appeal the judge's decision.

  We understand that it can be disappointing and frustrating if the judge did not grant you a restraining order after your hearing. We want to acknowledge your courage in seeking state protection for yourself and your loved ones. While we regret that we currently lack the capacity to assist with DVRO appeals, we want to encourage you not to lose hope. There are resources available to support you in exploring your options. 
  
  You can reach out to the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-3224 or find your local domestic violence legal help agencies to inquire about the possibility of an appeal by clicking the "Find Your Local DV Organization" button below. Remember, seeking help and taking steps to protect yourself is a courageous and important decision.
  
  ${card_start("Note: You can still file another Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order", color="info")}
  If the party against whom you sought the restraining order continues to abuse you, you can file a new Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order. In the declaration in your new forms, you may tell the judge that he or she has continued to abuse you and describe the most recent abuse.

#### @ Kelly, update the variables in this question block to whichever variables you use in the updated Next Steps and Info Sheet docx template files
question: |
  Case Information: Indicate the Orders Granted Your ROAH
subquestion: |
  Carefully review each order issued by the court during your hearing. If the court provided Restraining Order After Hearing (ROAH) forms for both you and ${resp.name.first}, please refer to the Restraining Order After Hearing form (DV-130) and mark the checkboxes below that correspond to the orders issued. Ensure that the checkboxes match the orders indicated on your DV-130 form (and DV-140 if child custody orders were issued).

  Please note that the list of orders below is not exhaustive and may not include all the orders issued. The checked boxes in the list below will determine the specific forms generated for you at the end of this interview.

  For a brief description of each order listed below, click the help button next to each order, which will also indicate the corresponding item number on the ROAH forms. Check all that apply:
fields: 
  - Child Support: requesting_childsupport
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      **Item 6 on form FL-342, Child Support Information and Order attachment.** Child support is the amount of money that a court orders a parent or both parents to pay every month to help pay for the support of the child (or children) and the child’s living expenses.
  - Spousal (or Partner) Support: requesting_spousalsupport
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      **Item 4 on form FL-343, Spousal, Domestic Partner, or Family Support Order Attachment.** Spousal Support (aka, Partner Support or Alimony) is a regular payment from one spouse to another. A spouse may request and receive **temporary** support orders (to support his or her expenses during the case), which can later be replaced by **permanent** support orders upon the determination of a judge at the hearing.
  - Child Custody and Visitation: requesting_custody
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      **Item 7 and Items 9-12, respectively, on form DV-140, Child Custody and Visitation Order.** Child Custody refers to the rights and responsibilities between parents for taking care of their children. Visitation (aka parenting time) refers to how and when each parent will spend time with the children.
  - Supervised Visitation: requesting_supervisedvisitation
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      **Items 10 and 12 on form DV-140, Child Custody and Visitation Order.** Supervised Visitation is most often ordered when a parent, in this case the other party, is determined to present a risk to the children’s safety or well-being, warranting the presence of a third party to supervise visits with the other parent. This third party can be a friend, relative, or a professional monitor.
  - Child Abduction Prevention Orders: requesting_childabduction
    datatype: yesno 
    help: |
      **Items 4-12 on form DV-145, Order to Prevent Child Abduction.** Child Abduction Prevention orders are designed to protect children from being wrongfully taken or retained by a parent or guardian and can include restrictions on visitation, traveling with the children, and more. 
  - Keep Minor's Information Confidential from the Public: requesting_confidentiality
    datatype: yesno

  **Scenario 1:** The court prepares the ROAH forms for you
subquestion: |
  To the best of our knowledge, most California Superior Courts prepare ROAH forms for self-representing parties if an ROAH is issued. If this is the case with your local court, ${court_name}, this means that after your hearing, the court will fill in the necessary ROAH forms for you to reflect the judge or judicial official's decision at your hearing(s). 
  
  After the court prepares these order forms, parties will typically receive them from the court clerk or through a designated court process.

question: |
  **Scenario 1:** The court prepares the ROAH forms for you. What's next?
subquestion: |
  **Step 1: Review the ROAH forms**

  It's important to carefully review the official court order forms for accuracy and completeness. 
  
  Verify that the restraining order's terms accurately reflect the judge's decision during the hearing. 
  
  If you notice any errors or discrepancies, promptly bring them to the attention of the court clerk. If you have any other questions or concerns about the order, it is advisable to seek guidance from the court's clerk, family law facilitator, or self-help center.
  
  ${card_start("Note on Enforcement:", color="info")}
  When enforcing the DVRO, the police will only consider the terms written in the official order itself, not the information contained in the court transcript or minute order. Therefore, it's crucial that you carefully review the order before leaving the court to ensure that it includes the specific terms you expected.

subquestion: |
  **Step 3: If necessary, have the conformed/endorsed ROAH forms served on ${resp.name.first}**

  If ${resp.name.first} or his/her lawyer attended the hearing(s), they are typically considered to have received notice of the orders issued by the judge. In such cases, it may not be necessary to serve ${resp.name.first} with a copy of the ROAH: 
  
  @ RYAN, do you think I should include pictures of this section of the DV-130?
  
  - In this scenario, box 'a' under Item 30 ("Service") on your Restraining Order After Hearing (form [DV-130](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv130.pdf)) will be checked. However, note that specific procedures for providing ${resp.name.first} notice of the ROAH can vary depending on your court and jurisdiction. 
  
  If the court orders that ${resp.name.first} must be served with a copy of the ROAH, follow the appropriate service method checked under Item 30 ("Service") on your Restraining Order After Hearing (form [DV-130](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv130.pdf)):
  
  - **If box 30(b)(1) is checked:** ${resp.name.first} can either be served in-person (using form [DV-200](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv200.pdf), the Proof of Personal Service) or by mail (using form [DV-250](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv250.pdf), the Proof of Service by Mail)
  - **If box 30(b)(2) is checked:** ${resp.name.first} must be personally served (given) a copy of the ROAH (using form [DV-200](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv200.pdf), the Proof of Personal Service)
  - **If box 30(b)(3) is checked:** the court has scheduled a firearms and ammunition compliance hearing, at which ${resp.name.first} must submit proof that he or she has sold or forfeited (turned-in) any firearms, firearm parts, or ammunition that he or she has. **If box 30(b)(3)(A) is checked:** you must have ${resp.name.first} personally served (given) a copy of the ROAH by the date specified in this section. **If box 30(b)(3)(B) is checked:** you must have ${resp.name.first} served with a copy of the ROAH by mail by the date specified in this section.

subquestion: |
  **Step 4: If you had to have ${resp.name.first} served, file the Proof of Service and make copies**

  After ${resp.name.first} has been served with the ROAH forms, file the proof of service form with the court clerk. If the local sheriff served ${resp.name.first} and informed you that they will file their own proof of service form, request a copy for your records. Verify that the filed proof of service form includes the date, time, and location of service, as well as the server's information and signature. This document serves as proof that the restrained party (${resp.name.first}) has been officially served with the ROAH. Filing the proof of service is important because police/law enforcement officers typically require proof that the restrained party is aware of the restraining order before they can enforce it.

  **Scenario 2:** The Court Has You Prepare Proposed ROAH Forms
subquestion: |
  **Step 1: Carefully review the court's instructions**
  
  If your local court requires you to prepare the ROAH forms, make sure to carefully follow any specific instructions provided by the court and accurately prepare the forms with relevant information.
  
   Please note that, as of 2023, we are aware of only 6 CA counties that do not prepare ROAH forms for self-representing parties: Alpine, Amador, Lake, Modoc, San Mateo, and Santa Clara.
  
  Again, most counties in California will prepare the ROAH forms for the parties. If yours does not, court staff may direct you to your local Self Help Center, whose staff can assist you in completing the orders based on the "minute order" received during the hearing.

question: |
  **Scenario 2:** The Court Has You Prepare Proposed ROAH Forms
subquestion: |
  **Step 2: Prepare your proposed order forms according to the minute order, court transcript, or other documents provided by the court**
  
  The "minute order" is a written record of the judge's orders as they were announced. In some cases, you may receive it at the end of the hearing. However, if it's not immediately available, you have the option to request a copy from the court clerk a few days after the hearing. 
  
  It is important to refer to the minute order when preparing the proposed ROAH forms. If desired, you can also purchase a transcript of the hearing from the court reporter, which provides a verbatim account of all the proceedings (keep in mind that transcripts can be costly, so it's wise to inquire about the cost beforehand).

  If my court has me prepare proposed ROAH forms, can I just use the proposed ROAH forms that UDIL generated for me at the end of previous interviews?
content: |
  To ensure that each of our users is as prepared as possible when heading to court, we generate proposed orders (ROAH forms customized with the specific orders you requested) available at the end of each previous UDIL interview (with the exception of Parts 1 and 2, the Roadmap and Case Information interviews). 
  
  You can easily resume each interview where you left off, presumably on the last page, and proceed to download or email the proposed order forms we generated to yourself.

  As a reminder, in instances where the court does not prepare the ROAH forms for you, you may be provided with a minute order or court transcript after your hearing. These documents will serve as references when you're preparing the proposed ROAH forms. It is important to use these documents to complete the ROAH forms accurately, as you'll need to prepare the ROAH forms in accordance with what the judge ordered during your hearing (not just the orders you requested). 

  In essence, while the proposed ROAH forms we generate for you serve as a helpful starting point, it's crucial to revise any sections where the judge's orders differ from the orders you requested. This will ensure that the final ROAH forms reflect the judge's specific orders and the outcome of your hearing.

subquestion: |
  **Step 3: Review the proposed ROAH forms and make copies for filing**
  
  Once you have prepared the proposed ROAH forms, it is important to take the necessary steps to finalize your official restraining order. 
  
  Begin by carefully reviewing the completed forms to ensure accuracy and consistency with the judge's orders in the minute order or other documents provided to you by court staff. Make sure all required information, such as names, dates, and case numbers, is properly filled in.

  Next, you will need to make copies of the completed ROAH forms. It is recommended to have both hard copies and electronic copies for your records. Keep in mind that some courts may require specific formatting or additional documents to accompany the order forms, so double-check your court's requirements.

subquestion: |  
  **Step 4: File the proposed ROAH Forms**
  
  After you've made copies of the proposed order forms, the next step is to file them with the court clerk. You can physically submit paper forms at your local courthouse's clerk's office or check if your court accepts electronic family law filings on its website.

  Once you've submitted your proposed orders, the court clerk will review them. If there are any mistakes or missing information, the clerk might ask you to make corrections or provide more details. It's important to address these requests quickly to ensure your proposed court order is approved by the judge and made official.

  When the court accepts your ROAH forms and they're signed by a judge or judicial officer, the orders are made official and entered into the court's and law enforcement's records. The clerk will give you file-stamped copies as proof of your submission. Keep these copies in a safe place, as they serve as evidence of the restraining order's issuance.

  **Step 5: If necessary, have the conformed/endorsed ROAH forms served on ${resp.name.first}**

  If ${resp.name.first} or his/her lawyer attended the hearing(s), they are typically considered to have received notice of the orders issued by the judge. In such cases, it may not be necessary to serve ${resp.name.first} with a copy of the ROAH: 
  
  - In this scenario, box 'a' under Item 30 ("Service") on your Restraining Order After Hearing (form [DV-130](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv130.pdf)) will be checked. However, note that specific procedures for providing ${resp.name.first} notice of the ROAH can vary depending on your court and jurisdiction. 
  
  If the court orders that ${resp.name.first} must be served with a copy of the ROAH, follow the appropriate service method checked under Item 30 ("Service") on your Restraining Order After Hearing (form [DV-130](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv130.pdf)):
  
  - **If box 30(b)(1) is checked:** ${resp.name.first} can either be served in-person (using form [DV-200](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv200.pdf), the Proof of Personal Service) or by mail (using form [DV-250](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv250.pdf), the Proof of Service by Mail)
  - **If box 30(b)(2) is checked:** ${resp.name.first} must be personally served (given) a copy of the ROAH (using form [DV-200](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv200.pdf), the Proof of Personal Service)
  - **If box 30(b)(3) is checked:** the court has scheduled a firearms and ammunition compliance hearing, at which ${resp.name.first} must submit proof that he or she has sold or forfeited (turned-in) any firearms, firearm parts, or ammunition that he or she has. **If box 30(b)(3)(A) is checked:** you must have ${resp.name.first} personally served (given) a copy of the ROAH by the date specified in this section. **If box 30(b)(3)(B) is checked:** you must have ${resp.name.first} served with a copy of the ROAH by mail by the date specified in this section.

  What happens if ${resp.name.first} is evading (avoiding) service or I don't know ${resp.name.first}'s current address?
subquestion: |
  If the court orders that ${resp.name.first} must be served a copy of the ROAH and you are unable to locate him or her, the court will typically allow you to serve the restraining order by mail to ${resp.name.first}'s last known address. 
  
  @ RYAN, Include picture here?
  
  If this is the case, **box 30(b)(1)** and/or **box 30(b)(3)(B)** will be checked under Item 30 ("Service") on your Restraining Order After Hearing ([form DV-130](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv130.pdf)). 
  
  However, if the court orders that ${resp.name.first} must be personally served (given) a copy of the ROAH, and if your server is unable to have ${resp.name.first} personally served, a judge may allow you to serve the ROAH on ${resp.name.first} another way. This is called alternative service.

  What happens if ${resp.name.first} is evading (avoiding) service or I don't know ${resp.name.first}'s current address?
subquestion: |
  To qualify for alternative service, you must show the judge two things: 
  
  1. You have tried many times (usually 3 or more times) to have someone personally serve ${resp.name.first}. Some examples of ways you can try to have ${resp.name.first} personally served: 
  
    - Serve ${resp.name.first} at his or her home, workplace, or somewhere he/she goes a lot
    - Search online for where ${resp.name.first} may be located
    - Check with ${resp.name.first}'s family or friends
  
  2. You believe ${resp.name.first} is avoiding (evading) service. Be ready to explain why you think ${resp.name.first} is evading service. If you have people who can help you prove this to a judge, you may bring them to your court hearing or have them write a statement that describes what they witnessed. 
  
  ${card_start("Note:", color="info")}
  Alternative service may involve other people having access to your court documents. This means that strangers may be able to see your name, the fact that the court granted you a restraining order against ${resp.name.first}, and other sensitive personal information. You may want to talk to an advocate about your safety and privacy concerns before you consider this request.

  Enforcing Your Restraining Order After Hearing
subquestion: |
  **Comply with the Orders:** 
 
  Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions outlined in your ROAH. Ensure that you fully understand your obligations and limitations as specified in the orders. 
  
  Adhere to these restrictions to protect your own safety and legal standing. Note, even if the protected person (you) invites or consents to contact with the restrained party (${resp.name.first}), the restraining orders remain in effect and must be enforced. 
  
  By law, the protected person cannot be arrested for inviting or consenting to contact with the restrained party. The orders can be changed only by another court order ([CA Penal Code section 13710(b)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=13710.&lawCode=PEN)).

question: |
  Enforcing Your Restraining Order After Hearing
subquestion: |
  **What if ${resp.name.first} violates the restraining order?**

  In case ${resp.name.first} disobeys any part of the order, it is a good practice to promptly inform law enforcement by calling 911 or contacting the police. You might consider providing law enforcement with a copy of the order and any evidence of the violations you may have.

  Additionally, it’s important to document any instances where ${resp.name.first} violates or threatens to violate the order. Keeping records of text messages, emails, or statements from witnesses that could serve as evidence of any violations can prove useful if you pursue further legal action. 
  
  Recording dates, times, detailed descriptions, and any other evidence relevant to documenting ${resp.name.first}'s violations could be important if you decide to modify or renew your ROAH before its expiration.
  
  ${card_start("Safety Warning:", color="warning")}
  Discussing your situation with a domestic violence victim's advocate could offer valuable insights into potential solutions and the best approach for ensuring your restraining order's enforcement. However, it is essential to stress that your personal safety and well-being must always be your top priority. **While documenting instances of violation is important, it should never take precedence over your safety or that of your loved ones during this process.**

  **Respond to the Call** 
content: |
  Once informed about a potential ROAH violation, police/law enforcement officers are required to respond promptly to the scene. They will assess the situation and take necessary actions to ensure the safety of the protected party.
---
template: verify_order
subject: |
  **Verify the Order** 
content: |
  The police/law enforcement will review the ROAH to confirm its validity and authenticity. They will examine the terms of the order and verify that it has been properly served on the restrained party (hence why you should keep endorsed/conformed (file-stamped) copies of the proof of service with the order).
---
template: document_violation
subject: |
  **Document the Violation** 
content: |
  Law enforcement officers should carefully document the alleged violation, including collecting evidence such as statements from the protected party, witnesses, and any available physical evidence. This documentation will be crucial for legal proceedings and future enforcement actions.
---
template: make_arrest
subject: |
  **Make an Arrest, if Appropriate** 
content: |
  If a ROAH has been issued by the court and a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that ${resp.name.first} had notice of the order and has violated it, they are mandated to arrest ${resp.name.first} as per Penal Code sections [836(c)(1)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=836.) and [13701(b)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=13701.&lawCode=PEN). Violation of the order may also constitute a breach of [Penal Code section 166](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=166.&lawCode=PEN). 
  
  In other words, if the violation is evident and supported by evidence, the police have the authority to proceed with an arrest, taking ${resp.name.first} into custody while following established procedures to ensure the safety of all parties involved.

template: provide_support
subject: |
  **Provide Assistance and Support** 
content: |
  Police officers should provide necessary assistance and support to you and any additional protected parties, including information on available resources, referrals to victim services, and guidance on further legal actions you can take.

template: report_incident
subject: |
  **Report and Document the Incident** 
content: |
  Law enforcement should complete an incident report detailing the DVRO violation. These reports are important for tracking and documenting the incidents, as well as for future reference in case of additional violations or legal proceedings. You are allowed to request copies of the incident report, as detailed on the next page. 
---
question: |
  How can I request a copy of the police/indident report after law enforcement documents a violation?
subquestion: |
  [California Family Code section 6228](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=6228.&lawCode=FAM) guarantees victims of domestic violence, or their representatives, access to copies of domestic violence incident reports. Upon request, state and local law enforcement agencies are required to provide one copy of the incident report face sheet or the complete incident report, free of charge. The face sheet should be available within 48 hours, and the full report within five working days, unless there are valid reasons for delay. 
  
  Requesters must provide identification, and this provision applies within five years from the date of the incident report's completion. This section empowers victims to obtain important documentation related to domestic violence incidents. 
  
  We encourage you to review the Family Code's exact language by clicking the hyperlink above. 

  You may use incident reports as evidence of ${resp.name.first}'s further abuse at later hearings to change or renew the restraining order, if applicable.

question: |
  Can my California DVRO/ROAH be enforced in another state?
subquestion: |
  Yes, it can. According to federal law (1 18 U.S.C. § 2265: Full faith and credit given to protection orders), "valid" Domestic Violence Restraining Orders (DVROs)/Restraining Orders After Hearing (ROAHs) issued in the United States are honored and upheld in all state and tribal courts across the country, including U.S. territories. 
  
  ${prog_disclose(federal_dvro_validity)}

  If your California DVRO/ROAH is deemed "valid" under the federal standards above, it can be enforced in another state. Each state is required to enforce out-of-state DVROs/ROAHs just as it does with its own orders.
  
  **Registration and Enforcement in Different States**

  Several states have laws or rules concerning the registration or filing of orders from other states, which can simplify enforcement. However, it's important to note that a valid DVRO/ROAH remains enforceable even if it hasn't been registered or filed in the new state. Since rules vary across states, it might be beneficial to understand the specific regulations in different states by meeting with a local domestic violence victim's advocate in your new state.

template: federal_dvro_validity
subject: |
  How to Determine if Your DVRO/ROAH is "Valid"
content: |
  Your DVRO/ROAH is "valid" and meets the federal criteria for enforcement across the US and US territories if:
  
  - The DVRO/ROAH was issued to prevent acts of violence, threats, harassment, sexual violence, or to ensure that a person doesn't come near or contact you. (18 U.S.C. § 2266(5)(A))
  - The court that issued the order had the legal authority to hear the case and make decisions about it.
  - The restrained party was given notice of the order and the chance to present their side in court. Their actual appearance in court is not crucial; what matters is that they had the opportunity to do so.
  - For temporary or emergency orders granted ex parte (without the restrained party present), the restrained party must still receive notice and have a chance to present their side in court at a hearing scheduled within a reasonable timeframe after the order is issued. (18 U.S.C. § 2265(a) & (b))

  The restraining order, except for the orders noted below,* end on the date specified in Item 4 ("Expiration Date") on the Restraining Order After Hearing ([form DV-130](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv130.pdf)).
  
  *Any custody, visitation, child support, and/or spousal support orders remain in effect after the restraining order ends. Custody, visitation, and child support orders usually end when the child is 18.
  
  If no date is written in this section, the restraining order ends three years after the date of the hearing written in Item 5a. If no time is written, the restraining order ends at midnight on the expiration date.
  
  Having a clear understanding of when your ROAH is set to expire will help you plan and initiate the renewal process in a timely manner.

question: |
   Can I request to permanently renew the ROAH?
subquestion: |
  As the ROAH nears its expiration date, if you're still worried about your safety or want your restraining order to remain effective, you can request to "renew" it. This extends its validity and establishes a new end date. In some instances, renewing the order can even lead to it becoming permanent, without a set expiration date.

  To maintain continuous protection, it's crucial to request a renewal BEFORE your current order expires. If you were granted a Restraining Order After Hearing, you can seek to renew it for an additional 5 years or even make it permanent WITHIN THREE MONTHS before its expiration, even if no new incidents of abuse have occurred.

  To support you in this process, we have prepared court forms for requesting the renewal of your Restraining Order After Hearing with your personal information. You can download these forms (form DV-700 and form DV-710) at the end of this interview.

  The following pages will provide more information on submitting a request for renewal, ensuring that you understand the process and come to the subsequent renewal hearing prepared, if applicable.

If the local sheriff served ${resp.name.first} and informed you that they will file their own proof of service form, request a copy for your records. 
  
  Verify that the proof of service form includes the date, time, and location of service, as well as the server's information and signature.This form serves as evidence that ${resp.name.first} received a copy of the Request to Renew and the Notice of Hearing. 
  
  Create 5 copies of the original Proof of Service.

  Take both the original and the copies to the court clerk's office at least 2 days before your scheduled hearing. The clerk will file the original and return the stamped "Filed" copies to you.

  What to Except at the Renewal Hearing: The Judge's Decision
subquestion: |
  For hearing preparation tips, we recommend that you review the Hearing Preparation section of our **Part 4: Next Steps** interview or reference the Hearing Preparation Tip Sheet available at the end of of that interview.
  
  At the hearing, the judge will determine whether to renew the restraining order. If you still fear the restrained person, you can communicate this to the judge. If there have been instances of abuse, harassment, or violations by the restrained person since the last order, you can provide the judge with evidence and details of these incidents.

question: |
  What to Except at the Renewal Hearing: The Judge's Decision
subquestion: |
  You do not need to demonstrate that ${resp.name.first} has abused you since the previous order. The judge will decide whether to renew the restraining order. The judge may also decide to issue a new order for an additional 5 years or even make it permanent, with no set end date.
  
  To decide if your request to renew the ROAH should be approved, the judge will decide if the evidence shows that the protected party (you) is entitled to a restraining order based on evidence of ${resp.name.first}'s abuse and the current safety risks posed towards the adults and children involved in the case. 
  
  At the end of your hearing, the judge will say what the orders are. The court may: 
  
  1. Renew the current restraining order for another five (5) years or permanently, or
  2. Deny the request to renew the current restraining order, in which case, the order will end on the date specified on the ROAH (form DV-130)

  **Step 1:** Prepare an Order to Renew Domestic Violence Restraining Order
content: |  
  Fill out an Order to Renew Domestic Violence Restraining Order ([form DV-730](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv730.pdf)). Then, attach the renewed restraining order (form DV-130) signed by the judge and submit it to the clerk. The judge will endorse (sign) form DV-730, renewing your restraining order.

  If the clerk prepares this order for you, review it carefully to ensure it aligns with the judge's orders.

  The clerk will file the original and provide you with up to 5 copies stamped "Filed."
---
template: renewal_aftermath2
subject: |
  **Step 2:** Serve ${resp.name.first}
content: |
  - If ${resp.name.first} did not attend the hearing and the renewed orders differ from form DV-130 (even slightly), you must have ${resp.name.first} personally served with form DV-730. The server should complete a Proof of Personal Service (form DV-200) and provide it to you.
  - If ${resp.name.first} or his/her attorney (if applicable) attended the hearing, you can serve him or her a copy of form DV-730 by mail. Ask the server to complete a Proof of Service by Mail (form DV-250) and provide it to you for filing.
  - If neither ${resp.name.first} nor his/her attorney (if applicable) are present at the hearing, but the renewed orders are exactly the same as form DV-130 (except for the end date), you can also serve form DV-730 by mail. The server should complete a Proof of Service by Mail (form DV-250) and provide it to you.
---
template: renewal_aftermath3
subject: |
  **Step 3:** File Your Proof of Service
content: |
  Create 5 copies of the completed Proof of Service (form DV-200 or form DV-250) and file the original and the copies with the court clerk. The clerk will file the original and return the copies stamped "Filed" to you for your records and service onto ${resp.name.first}.

  The court will forward the Proof of Service and form DV-730 to law enforcement on your behalf, ensuring that authorities are aware the restrained person has knowledge of the orders. 
  
  In case the clerk cannot send your form DV-730 and Proof of Service to law enforcement, provide 1 copy to your local police for entry into the state computer system.

  **Step 4:** Keep a Copy of the Renewed ROAH With You 
content: |
  Keep a copy of the Order to Renew Domestic Violence Restraining Order (form DV-730), along with your Restraining Order After Hearing (form DV-130) and the filed Proof of Service, with you AT ALL times.

  The court recommends that you:
  
  - keep another copy stored securely for potential use when dealing with law enforcement, 
  - distribute a copy of the new order to any relevant parties and establishments that had the previous one, and 
  - ensure your local police have a copy of your order to renew the restraining order.

question: |
  Can I change or end the restraining orders? 
subquestion: |
  **Amending or Ending Your ROAH through Request for Order (RFO)**

  As circumstances change, you may find it necessary to amend or end your ROAH. The Request for Order (RFO) process allows you to formally request changes to your existing order or to terminate it altogether. While U Do It Legal currently does not offer assistance with RFOs, we recognize their importance and plan to provide support for this process in 2024.

  **Requesting Changes to Your ROAH (Amendment)**

  If you need to modify certain terms of your ROAH, such as visitation arrangements or financial support, you can file an RFO with the court. The RFO outlines the changes you are seeking and provides supporting reasons. It's important to thoroughly understand the process and legal requirements before proceeding. Legal aid organizations and attorneys specializing in family law can offer guidance during this stage.

  **Terminating Your ROAH (Ending the Order)**

  If you believe the circumstances warrant the termination of your ROAH, you can initiate the RFO process to formally end the order. Keep in mind that this process requires a thorough understanding of the legal procedures and grounds for ending the order. Legal aid organizations and attorneys can provide valuable assistance in this situation.

  ${card_start("Note on RFO Services:", color="info")}
  While we do not currently provide guidance on the RFO process, we are committed to expanding our services to cover this aspect of domestic violence law in 2024.

  - **California Partnership to End Domestic Violence (CPEDV):** Visit [CPEDV's website](https://www.cpedv.org/) to find a directory of domestic violence organizations and shelters across California. These organizations offer a range of services, including emergency shelter, legal assistance, counseling, and support groups.
  - **Legal Aid Organizations:** Legal aid organizations in California can provide you with legal advice and assistance. Search online for legal aid services specific to your area or visit your local courthouse to inquire about available resources.
  - **Counseling and Support Services:** Seeking counseling or therapy can help you cope with the emotional and psychological impact of domestic violence. Many organizations and therapists specialize in trauma recovery and can provide you with the tools to heal.
  - **Emergency Shelters:** If you are in immediate danger, consider reaching out to a local domestic violence shelter. These shelters offer a safe and confidential place to stay, along with support services.
