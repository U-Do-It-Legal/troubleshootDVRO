  What is a Temporary Restraining Order? 
content: |
  A temporary restraining order, or TRO, is an order for one person to temporarily stay away from another person, including their home, vehicle, work, and protected household or family members. If a TRO is granted, the court can also order the abusive person to do things like move out of a shared residence, pay utility bills or child support, not contact you, etc. 

  TROs can be valid for around three weeks (or until the scheduled court hearing) and may be made permanent after a hearing. Additionally: 
  
  - Anyone 12 and over can apply for a TRO without parental consent
  - A TRO must be filed in civil court, not criminal
  - The respondent (aka the restrained party/person abusing you) must be served with the TRO before police can enforce the order (*we will explain service at the end of this interview*)
  - A TRO is **only valid and enforceable until the date of the hearing**
---
template: court_hearing_explanation
subject: |
	Court Hearing
content: |
  Once you submit your court forms, the court will schedule a hearing on your request. If the judge does not make the orders effective right away (i.e. grant your TRO), the judge may still make the orders after the hearing (i.e. grant your DVRO). If the judge does not make the orders effective right away, you can ask the court to cancel the hearing.

template: dvro_explanation
subject: |
	What is a Domestic Violence Restraining Order?
content: |
  Just like a TRO, a Domestic Violence Restraining Order can help protect you from an abusive partner, a family member, or someone in your household. In California, we often call this order a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (also known as a “Restraining Order After Hearing (ROAH)"). 
  
  The DVRO is a “permanent” restraining order issued by the court against the restrained party **after a hearing**. A DVRO provides the same specific restrictions of a TRO and may be ordered for up to five years. The victim may renew the order when it expires, if necessary. 
---
template: violating_orders_explanation
subject: |
	Violating the Orders 
content: |
  If the abusive person does not obey a TRO or DVRO, they “violate” it. It is a crime to violate a domestic violence restraining order and the police can arrest them. We will include information on how to enforce a TRO and DVRO in your "Next Steps" interview.

question: |
  **Introduction to TROs and DVROs**

  ${prog_disclose(dvro_explanation)}
  
  ${prog_disclose(violating_orders_explanation)}
  
  ${card_start("Summary:", color="info")}

  1) *If granted,* a TRO can protect you and your loved ones before and up until the date of your hearing.
  
  2) Even if a judge doesn't grant your request for a TRO, you may still be granted a DVRO at your hearing.
  
  3) *If granted,* a DVRO (aka ROAH) can protect you and your loved ones after your hearing, for up to 5 years. You may renew your DVRO before it expires, if necessary. 
  ${card_end()}
  
  ${card_start("Safety Planning:", color="warning")}
  A restraining order is only a part of your overall safety plan. We highly encourage you to speak with a domestic violence advocate for more help with safety planning.

  More information on Batterer Intervention Programs
content: |
  Batterer intervention programs (BIPs) are programs designed to help individuals who have been abusive or violent in their relationships to change their behavior and learn to interact non-violently with their partners. 

  BIPs typically involve group therapy sessions that focus on teaching participants how to identify and change the attitudes and behaviors that contribute to violence and abuse. These programs may also include education about the dynamics of power and control in relationships, as well as skills training to help participants communicate more effectively and resolve conflicts peacefully.

  Some BIPs may also include individual therapy sessions or other forms of support, such as substance abuse treatment or anger management. The length and frequency of BIP sessions can vary, but they typically involve weekly or biweekly sessions over the course of several months or longer.

  It is important to note that while BIPs can be helpful in some cases, they are not a guarantee that ${resp.name.first} will stop being abusive. It is important for individuals who have experienced domestic violence to also seek out support and safety for themselves, and to have a plan in place in case the abuser does not change their behavior.

question: |
  **Requesting Orders:** Batterers Intervention Program 
subquestion: |
  Batterer Intervention Programs (BIPs) are court-ordered programs designed for perpetrators of domestic violence. These programs may consist of educational classes, treatment groups, evaluations, individual counseling, and case management. 
  
  If you request that ${resp.name.first} be ordered to attend a BIP, he or she will have to pay for and attend weekly classes in a 52-week batterer intervention program that teaches accountability, abuse effects, and gender roles to help stop abuse. If ordered to complete the program, ${resp.name.first} would have to show proof to the judge that he or she enrolled in the program.

question: |
  **Requesting Orders:** Extend my Deadline to Give Notice
subquestion: |
  Usually, the judge will give you about two weeks to give notice, or to "serve" ${resp.name.first}. If you need more time to serve (i.e., have someone give a copy of your restraining order to ${resp.name.first}), the judge may be able to give you a few extra days. 
  
  In other words, you can ask the court to shorten the time between service and your hearing, so long as you can show the judge that there is good cause (a good enough reason) to do so.

  ${card_start("Note:", color="info")}
  If you are granted a Temporary Restraining Order (aka a TRO, which lasts until the hearing), **law enforcement cannot enforce the order until ${ resp.name.first } is served** (given a copy of the order).

  What is Spousal Support?
content: |
  Spousal Support is a regular payment from one spouse to another. A spouse may request and receive **temporary** support orders (to support his or her expenses during the case), which can later be replaced by **permanent** support orders. "Permanent" support orders are synonymous with long-term support orders, as limitations on support may apply and support amounts can be changed if the parties' financial circumstances change.

  How is Spousal Support Determined?
content: |
  When determining if a spouse spouse should pay support, and in what amount, the court tries to determine the extent to which each spouse's earning capacity (potential to earn income) is sufficient to maintain the marital standard of living (i.e., the lifestyle and spending habits maintained during the marriage). The court considers the following factors:
  
  - The supported spouse's marketable skills and qualifications, as well as the time and expenses of any further education or training needed to enter the job market
  - The length of unemployment that the supported spouse incurred in order to fulfill domestic responsibilities and its effect on his or her employment prospects  
  - The supporting spouse's ability to make payments (based on the paying spouse's earning capacity, earned and unearned income, assets, and standard of living income)
  - The length of the marriage
  - The custodial arrangements of any dependents (such as minor children or adult children with disabilities) 
  - Both parties’ assets and debts
  - Both parties’ age and health

  What is Child Support?
content: |
  Child support is the amount of money that a court orders a parent or both parents to pay every month to help pay for the support of the child (or children) and the child’s living expenses.
---
template: cs_factors_explanation
subject: |
  What factors does the court look at when ordering child support?
content: |  
  In California Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) cases, the amount of child support that must be paid is determined based on several factors that help the court determine the family's pre-DVRO standard of living, such as:
    
    - custody and visitation terms (i.e., where do the children live and which parents make parenting decisions), 
    - each parent's income level, 
    - each parent's ability to earn, 
    - each parent's assets and debts, 
    - the number of children involved, and 
    - the child or children's expenses and needs. 
    
    The goal of child support in DVROs is to uphold the child's post-DVRO standard of living and to protect their best interests. 
  
  If the noncustodial parent (i.e., the parent that the children do not live with) has a high income and the ability to earn, the court may order them to pay child support to the lesser-earning custodial parent. The court must determine the best course of action to protect the children's best interests if a noncustodial parent cannot afford child support for multiple children.

  **Option 1: Ask for Child Support through a Family Law Case (in your case, the Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order)**
content: |  
  You may request and receive **temporary** support orders to support your children during the DVRO case, which can later be replaced by **permanent** support orders. "Permanent" support orders are synonymous with long-term support orders, as a child support order can be changed by a new order or a stipulation approved by the court. Either parent has the right to ask for a review of the child support order if there is a change in circumstances of either person.

  **Option 2: Ask for Child Support through a case filed by your Local Child Support Agency (LCSA)**
content: |  
  - (a) If you or ${resp.name.first} have been getting public assistance, such as  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the LCSA automatically files a child support case against the noncustodial parent.  The case also includes as a party the custodial parent that is receiving public assistance.
  - (b) Either parent can ask the LCSA to provide child support services, which will then start a child support case.
  - (c) If a child is in foster care, the LCSA may start a child support case against one or both parents.
  - (d) Either parent can ask the LCSA to take over enforcement of a child support order in a family law case (like a divorce, parentage, or DVRO case). 
  
  For more information on the LCSA child support process, please visit the California Court website's page, [Asking for a Child Support Order](https://www.courts.ca.gov/1194.htm#acc11469), and click the tab labelled "Starting a case with the local child support agency"

  **Requesting Orders:** Child Custody and Visitation

question: |
  **Requesting Orders:** Child Custody and Visitation
subquestion: |
  Separated parents need to agree between themselves, or have a court decide and order, how and when each parent will spend time with their children (this is physical custody and visitation), and how decisions will be made for their children (this is legal custody). This is the essence of child custody and visitation. The following pages provide an overview of child custody and visitation, and the possible orders that can be requested. At a basic level:

  - **Child Custody** refers to the rights and responsibilities between parents for taking care of their children.
  - **Visitation** (aka parenting time) refers to how and when each parent will spend time with the children.
  
  Sometimes parents can agree on custody and visitation, also referred frequently in the courts as a “parenting plan.” Other times parents need the court to decide on the specific custody and visitation orders because they cannot agree on these orders. 
  
  **Helpful Resources**
  
  For an overview of the child custody and visitation process, please read the [Child Custody Information Sheet](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl314info.pdf).
  
  We also highly encourage you to review the California Court System's [Families Change Website](https://www.familieschange.ca.gov/), which offers a [free course](https://pas.familieschange.ca.gov/en/course/25-parenting-plan) that helps parents, teens, and children deal with a family break up. You will find links to services that can help you and other types of resources.

question: |
  **Types of Custody:** What is Legal Custody?
subquestion: |
  There are two different types of custody: **legal** and **physical**. 
  
  **Legal Custody:** who makes important, long-term decisions about a child’s upbringing and welfare, such as: 
  
  * Where will the child go to school? 
  * Who will be the child’s doctor? 
  * Should the child undergo any special medical or mental health treatment? 
  * What religion should the child practice (if any)? 
  * In which sports or activities should the child participate? 
  
  As a parent, you can request sole or joint legal custody orders: 
  
    - **Joint Legal Custody:** Both parents make these decisions.
  
    - **Sole Legal Custody:** One parent makes these decisions.
   
   Joint legal custody is most commonly awarded in cases unless the court finds one parent is unfit or incapable of making these decisions. The court makes its determination of custody based on what is best for the child—NOT the parents.
   
  ${card_start("Note:", color="info")}
  Joint legal custody is typically not appropriate for cases in which domestic violence, substance abuse, or child neglect is present.

question: |
  **Types of Custody:** What is Physical Custody?
subquestion: |
  Again, there are two different types of custody: **legal** and **physical**. 
  
  **Physical Custody:** Who the children live with. 
  
  As a parent, you can request sole, joint, or primary physical custody orders: 
  
    - **Sole Physical Custody:** The children live in one parent’s household.
    
    - **Joint Physical Custody:** The children live in both parents' households and alternate homes based on an agreed upon visitation schedule.
  
    - **Primary Physical Custody:** The children live in both parents' households, but the children live with one parent significantly more that 50% of the custodial time (for example: the children live with one parent during the school year and the other parent during summer vacation).
  
  ${card_start("Note:", color="info")}
  Joint and primary physical custody arrangements are typically inappropriate for cases in which domestic violence, substance abuse, or child neglect is present.

question: |
  **Types of Custody:** Physical Custody vs. Visitation
subquestion: | 
  Please note the difference between physical custody and vistation. **Physical custody determines which household the child or children live in**, whereas **visitation outlines the days and times that the child or children spends with each parent**.
   
  For example, if you request sole physical custody of your child, this means that you're requesting that your child will live in your household--NOT that they do not get to spend any time with ${resp.name.first}.

Reasonable Visitation requires both parents to stay in consistent contact with one another, and this type of visitation arrangement becomes problematic if you and the other parent cannot agree on when visitation will be after reasonable visitation is ordered.

  Family Code section 3044
content: |
  [Family Code 3044](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&sectionNum=3044.) states that a judicial finding of domestic violence (i.e., when a judge grants a permanent domestic violence restraining order or a parent is convicted of criminal domestic violence charges) creates a presumption against joint custody, specifically, that joint custody is no longer in the best interest of the child. This creates a burden of proof that an abuser must meet in order for a court to order joint child custody after a retraining order is issued.
  
  In other words, if a parent is convicted or found by a court to have committed domestic violence for an incident that happened in the last five years, then the court will presume that the abusive parent **should not be awarded joint (or sole) legal and physical custody of a child**, and will require the abusive parent to prove to the court otherwise based on the law that governs these situations. 
---
template: famcode3044_explanation2
subject: |
  How does this (see info box above) apply to your situation?
content: |
  If the court grants your domestic violence restraining order against ${resp.name.first}, there will be a presumption that shared custody is not in the best interest of your children. If ${resp.name.first} cannot overcome the presumption against him or her having joint or sole legal and physical custody of your children, the court will typically grant the other parent (in this case, you) sole legal and physical custody of the child, with ${resp.name.first} having some form of visitation. 
  
  Additionally, **if the judge grants your DVRO and gives any custody or unsupervised visits to ${resp.name.first}, the judge must clearly explain the reasons for doing so.**

question: |
  **Requesting Orders:** Visitation 
subquestion: |
  You can ask a judge to make decisions about when your child spends time with ${resp.name.first}. This is called parenting time or visitation. It means the schedule and exact times each parent spends with the child. If a parent does not get custody, that parent can have parenting time with the child if a judge believes it is safe and in the child’s best interest. Answer the questions below to tell the judge what parenting time you want right now for ${resp.name.first}. Any orders the judge makes are temporary for now. They last until the court date (about three weeks away, after filing). On your court date, the judge can change or extend the orders.

template: sv_explanation

  As a Reminder: What is supervised visitation?
content: |
  Remember, supervised visitation requires that a parent's visitation with the children is monitored by another person. This is usually ordered by a court when one parent might be a danger to the children's safety or well-being. The person doing the monitoring could be someone the family knows, like a friend or relative, or it could be a professional monitor. Sometimes, the court orders supervised visits in reunification situations (i.e., when a parent hasn't seen their kids for a long time and needs help getting back in touch with them).
  
  Keep in mind, supervised visitation might not go on forever. If ${resp.name.first} does what's required or if the court thinks he or she no longer presents a danger to the children, ${resp.name.first} may get more time with the children, maybe even overnight visits. If overnight visits are allowed, the supervision will stop.

template: prof_sv_explanation
subject: |
  Professional Supervisors
content: |
  A professional supervision provider is a person who has special training and has passed a background check. They charge money for their services. Additionally, because they are mandated reporters, professional providers have to tell the local child welfare department (Child Protective Services, or "CPS") if they suspect that a child is being abused. Professional providers can be used for visits that are only a short time, like one or two hours. If you request a professional supervisor, you'll need to think about who will pay for the supervisor. It's important to know that you might have to pay some of the supervisor's costs too.

template: nonprof_sv_explanation
subject: |
  Non-Profesional Supervisors
content: |
  A nonprofessional supervision provider is usually someone the family knows, like a friend or relative, who doesn't have special training. If it would be dangerous for your child to be alone with the other parent, this may not be the best option.
---
template: prov_vs_nonprof_explanation
subject: |
  Should I ask for a professional or non-professional supervisor?
content: |
  Professional providers have special rules and training to handle situations that might be dangerous, like domestic violence or child abduction (kidnapping). Nonprofessional providers don't have this training or experience. Sometimes, using a professional provider is not possible because of costs or language barriers.

  This will depend on the age and needs of your children, your and ${resp.name.first}'s work schedules, and the availability of the supervision provider. Your visitation schedule should focus on what you think will be best for your children, NOT what would be best for you or ${resp.name.first}.

template: sv_transportation_explanation
subject: |
  Who should take the children to and from the visit?
content: |  
  You can ask someone you trust to bring your children to and from the visits. The person who drives the children must have a driver's license and car insurance. If you don't have anyone to help you with driving, professional providers have rules in place to keep both parents safe during visitation exchanges.

  You've indicated that you would like to use the template below to request a visitation schedule. 
  
  If this is incorrect, please go back and uncheck the box labelled: "Check here if you want to use the chart pictured below to create a visitation schedule."

  % if supervised_visitation_supervisor == 'supervised_visitation_professional':
  **Remember, professional supervision providers can be used for visits that are only a short time, like one or two hours.**
  % endif
  
  To use the visitation schedule template, simply check the box next to each day you want ${resp.name.first} to have a supervised visit. Then, fill in the fields that appear. If there's a field you don't want to fill in, just leave it blank.

  You can be as detailed or as general as you want when making your visitation schedule. But keep in mind, if your schedule isn't specific, it might be hard for the court to enforce it. Including information like the exact days, dates, times for visits, where the visits will happen, and where the kids will be dropped off and picked up will make your order more enforceable.

  **Preparing and Filing your court forms**
subquestion: | 
  Not every courthouse accepts restraining order papers. Find the courthouse in your county that will file restraining order papers by going to Find my Court and looking under "Matters Served" and find the nearest courthouse that accepts restraining orders or family cases.

  At the courthouse, you’ll file the forms by giving the original and two copies to the clerk. Your forms will then be reviewed by a judge. The clerk will let you know when to return to pick up your court papers.

  **What to expect after filing your court forms**
subquestion: |
  After you've filed your paperwork, find out when it will be ready for pickup. The judge may be able to review your request that  same day. If not, you will need to go back to the courthouse  the next day. Ask the clerk when you should return to pick up your court papers.

  **What to expect after filing your court forms**
subquestion: | 
  If you filed your paperwork online, some courts may provide you with a copy by email. You should check in with the court clerk or self-help center to find out how to get your restraining order papers. 
  
  When you ask the court for a domestic violence restraining order, the judge can do 3 things:

  1. Deny your request/refuse to give you a restraining order. ${ resp } will not get any notice that you asked the court for a restraining order.

  2. Make a temporary order. The judge will give you a temporary restraining order (aka a TRO) that lasts until your hearing. At the hearing, the judge can hear from both you and ${ resp } at the same time.

  3. Not make any order until they can hear from both you and ${ resp } at the same time. If the judge decides not to make an order and you decide to go to a hearing where the judge can hear from both of you, ${ resp } will find out you have asked for a restraining order.
