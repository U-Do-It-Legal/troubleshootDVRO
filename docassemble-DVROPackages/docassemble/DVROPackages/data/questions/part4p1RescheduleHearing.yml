template: dv_116_explanation
subject: |
  **DV-116,** Order on Request to Reschedule Court Hearing 
content: |
  The DV-116 form is used by the court to document the court's decision on your request to reschedule the court hearing through form DV-115. The form includes information such as the original hearing date and time, the new hearing date and time (if the continuance was granted), and any additional information the court may want to include.
  
  Please note that we do not complete this form on your behalf. The official court order can only be prepared and issued by the judge/judicial officer assigned to your case. The judge/judicial officer will specify on this form which orders are granted or denied, any additional orders being made, and will sign the order form. However, our website will prepare a proposed order that you would like the judge to issue, which you can give to the court clerk alongside your DV-115. This proposed order helps streamline the process for the court in completing the form accurately.
---
template: dv_115_explanation
subject: |
  **DV-115,** Request to Continue Hearing
content: |
  The DV-115 form allows you to ask the court to reschedule your hearing for a later date, for reasons such as being unable to attend or needing more time to prepare. If the request is granted and the hearing is rescheduled, you will be notified of the new hearing date and time.
---
template: pos_forms
subject: |
  **Proof of Service** Documents
content: |
  - **DV-200,** Proof of Personal Service
  - **DV-200-INFO,** Proof of Service Information Sheet
  - **DV-205-INFO,** Service Evasion Information Sheet
  
  As a reminder, the Proof of Service is a legal document that serves as the official record that the Other Party (the person against whom a restraining order is sought) has been properly served with the court papers relating to the case. After the person serving the papers (theserver) has delivered the documents to the Other Party, the server prepares Form DV-200. This form details when, where, and how the papers were served, providing a critical record of service.

  It's essential to file a completed proof of service with the court before the hearing on the restraining order. The judge will use this form to confirm that the Other Party was duly served and had adequate notice of the proceedings.

  How is "good cause" defined under California Law?
content: |
  [Rule 3.1332.](https://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=three&linkid=rule3_1332) Motion or application for continuance of trial in the 2023 California Rules of Court states the following:
  
  (c) Grounds for continuance

  Although continuances of trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits. The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance. **Circumstances that may indicate good cause include:**

  - (1)  The unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;
  - (2)  The unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;
  - (3)  The unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;
  - (4)  The substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;
  - (5)  The addition of a new party if:
      (A)  The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or
      (B)  The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's involvement in the case;
  - (6)  A party's excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts; or
  - (7)  A significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for trial.
---
template: resp_continuance_explanation
subject: |
  Can the Other Party request to reschedule the hearing?
content: |
  In short, yes. Keep in mind that after the Other Party is served the Temporary Restraining Order (or Notice of Court Hearing, if a TRO was not granted), he or she can ask for more time to get ready for the hearing. The judge might agree to their request and change the date of the hearing by issuing the form DV-116, Order on Request to Continue Hearing. This can be based on any of the "good cause" grounds above or their first-time request for more time (this ground is reserved for the Other Party, who's hearing preparation is limited to the time between when they're served and the scheduled court date).
---
question: |
  Reasons to File a Request to Reschedule Hearing
subquestion: |
  You may need to ask for a new court date if:
  
  - You are unable to have the Other Party served in time before your court date
  - You have a good reason for needing a new court date (the court may grant your request to reschedule your court date in a showing of "good cause")

---
template: continuance_granted_explanation
subject: |
  If the Request to Reschedule Hearing is Granted
content: |
  If your request to reschedule the hearing is granted, you must have the Other Party served with (given) a copy of the court papers as described in Item 7 on form DV-116. The person who you have serve the papers will need to complete a Proof of Personal Service (form DV-200) and give it to you. The sheriff should be able to serve your papers free of charge. 
  
  You must file the signed Proof of Service form with the court clerk before the new hearing date to prove that the Other Party was notified of the hearing's new date, time, and location.
---
template: continuance_denied_explanation
subject: |
  If the Request to Reschedule Hearing is Denied
content: |
  If the judge denies your request to reschedule the hearing, you must go to the court hearing at the date, time, and location under Item 3 on form DV-109: Notice of Court Hearing. This date should match the date written on form DV-116: Order on Request to Continue Hearing. 

  You must attend the hearing if you want the judge to make restraining orders or continue any orders already made. If you cancel the hearing or do not attend the hearing, any restraining orders made on form DV-110 will end on the date of the hearing and you will have to completely restart your case.
---
template: continuance_granted_tro_explanation
subject: |
  If you have a Temporary Restraining Order
content: |
  If the court granted your temporary restraining order and the judge grants your request to reschedule the hearing, the court will also extend the expiration date of the temporary restraining order until the new court date. The clerk will send the updated restraining order to law enforcement, or CLETS, for you. CLETS is a statewide computer system that lets police know about the order.

question: |
  What happens after I request to reschedule the hearing?
subquestion: |  
  ${card_start("Note:", color="info")}
  All of the information below will be included on a "Next Steps" document generated at the end of this interview.
  ${card_end()}
  
  After filing form DV-115 with the court clerk, the judge will need to review the Request to Reschedule Hearing. You may need to check with the clerk's office to see when you will be notified of the judge's decision. The court can approve or deny your request to reschedule the court date. If the request is granted and the judge signs form DV-116, you will receive a new court date. If the judge does not sign the form, you'll have to attend the original court date as indicated on form DV-109.

template: tro_granted_explanation
subject: |
  How can I check whether I was issued a TRO?
content: |
  For a quick way to check if the court granted you any Temporary Restraining Orders, look at Item 4, "Temporary Restraining Orders" on form DV-109: the Notice of Court Hearing. 
  
  If boxes 4a(1) or 4a(3) are checked, the court has temporarily granted all or some of the orders you requested under a TRO. If box 4a(2) is checked, you were not issued a TRO. 
  
  To see which orders were granted, look at form DV-110 and go down to Item 8. If the judge checked any of the boxes that say "Granted as follows" under Items 8 through 23, this means that the judge has granted those orders temporarily. 
  
  Remember, any orders granted as part of your TRO only last until your court date. 
---
template: tro_denied_explanation
subject: |
  What happens if the court did not issue a TRO? 
content: |
  For a quick way to see if the court did *not* issue you any Temporary Restraining Orders, look at Item 4, "Temporary Restraining Orders" on form DV-109: the Notice of Court Hearing. 
  
  If box 4a(2) is checked, the court did not issue you a TRO. The judge must indicate why he or she denied the orders under Item 4b. However, the judge may still grant or deny any of the orders you've requested after hearing from both sides at your hearing.
  
  You can also check by looking at form DV-110 and going down to Item 8. If the judge checked "Denied until the hearing" for *every single* order you requested between Items 8 and 23, this means that the court did not issue you a Temporary Restraining Order.

  Prepped DV-116 Reminder
content: |
  As a reminder: Bring this form with you when filing form DV-115. Please note that we did not complete this form on your behalf. The official court order can only be issued by the judicial officer assigned to your case, who will indicate which orders are granted or denied and sign the order form. However, we assist by pre-populating the form with your case information and the specific orders you are requesting, which you can give to the court clerk alongside your DV-115. This helps streamline the process for the court in completing the form accurately.
