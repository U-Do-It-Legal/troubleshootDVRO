  **Criminal Protective Order** (CPO)
content: |
  **Purpose:**

  A Criminal Protective Order (CPO) is a court order that protects a victim of a crime, including domestic violence, from the person who committed the crime, often referred to as the “defendant” or “other party.” In cases where the defendant is charged with a crime related to domestic violence by the District Attorney, the CPO is issued to protect the victim from further abuse and to ensure the victim’s safety during the criminal proceedings.
  
  **Issuance:**
  
  A CPO is issued by a criminal court judge at the defendant’s arraignment or at any point during the criminal proceedings if the judge believes it is necessary to protect the victim. A CPO can also be issued in conjunction with a criminal protective order petition filed by the victim with the court.
  
  **Duration:**

  A CPO can be issued for the duration of the criminal proceedings and, if the defendant is convicted of the crime, the order can remain in effect for up to 10 years.

  **Availability:**

  A CPO can only be issued in connection with a criminal case and is not a substitute for a DVRO. If a victim of domestic violence wants protection beyond the duration of the criminal proceedings, they will need to file a petition for a DVRO with the family court.

  **Notice:**

  The other party is notified of the CPO at the time of their arraignment or when the order is issued, and the order is enforceable by law enforcement.

  ${card_start("Note:", color="light")}
  A CPO is separate from a DVRO and is issued in a criminal court, while a DVRO is issued in civil/family court. U Do It Legal does not handle or assist with CPOs or criminal matters. However, we do help people navigate the TRO and DVRO/ROAH processes described in the info boxes above. For more information regarding the criminal process, you may watch [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EJ4GcKGtKMs8FslD6DFB20QsiuFGO7Qn/view).

template: epo_explanation
subject: |
  **Emergency Protective Order** (EPO)
content: |
  **Purpose:** 

  An EPO is issued to provide immediate, short-term protection from domestic violence, stalking, or other forms of abuse.

  **Issuance:**

  Upon the request of a law enforcement (police) officer, EPOs can be issued by a judge. EPOs are typically issued when the officer believes someone is in immediate danger and needs protection.

  **Duration:**

  An EPO is valid for a brief period, usually up to 7 days.

  **Availability:** 

  EPOs can be issued 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and can be obtained without the person seeking protection appearing in court.

  **Notice:**

  The person being restrained (other party) does not need to be present or notified before the EPO is issued.
  
  ${card_start("Note", color="info")}
  Law enforcement officers (police) must initiate the issuance of an EPO by a judge. Because of this, U Do It Legal does not handle or assist with EPOs. However, we do help people navigate the TRO and DVRO/ROAH processes described in the info boxes above. 
  ${card_end()}
---
template: tro_explanation
subject: |
  **Temporary Restraining Order** (TRO)
content: |
  **Purpose:**

  A temporary restraining order, or TRO, is issued to provide short-term protection from abuse or harassment defined under the law until a court hearing can take place to decide whether a permanent longer-term restraining order is necessary.

  More specifically, a TRO is an order for one person to temporarily stay away from another person, including their home, vehicle, work, and, if applicable, protected household or family members, if requested. If a TRO is granted, and if requested, the court can also order the abusive person to do things like move out of a shared residence, pay utility bills or child support, not contact you, and the like.


  Additionally: 

  - Anyone 12 and over can apply for a TRO without parental consent.
  - A TRO must be filed in civil/family court, not criminal court.
  
  **Issuance:**

  TROs are issued by a judge after a person seeking protection (the Petitioner) files a request in court. If granted, TROs are typically issued the same-day or the following day.

  **Duration:**

  A TRO typically lasts two to three weeks and is **only valid and enforceable until the date of the hearing.** A judge decides whether to issue a more permanent restraining order at the hearing.

  **Availability:**

  TROs can only be issued during court hours, and the petitioner typically needs to appear in court to request one. California court hours vary from courthouse to courthouse, but are generally 8:30 AM to 4:30PM. For specific hours and department calendar schedules, visit your local Superior Court website for more information. 

  **Notice:**

  Under certain circumstances, a judge may issue a TRO without first notifying the other party of the request if there is a strong basis that notifying the other party may cause harm to or put the petitioner in danger. However, the other party must be served with (given) the TRO before police can enforce the order (we explain service in your “Next Steps” interview).

  **Domestic Violence Restraining Orders** (DVRO) / **Restraining Orders After Hearing** (ROAH) 
content: |
  **Purpose:**
   
  Like a TRO, a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) can help protect you from an abusive partner, a family member, or someone in your household. In California, we often call this order a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (also known as a “Restraining Order After Hearing, “ROAH”).   

  The DVRO/ROAH is a “permanent” restraining order issued by the court against the other party **after a hearing**. It may provide the same specific restrictions as a TRO, or impose greater restrictions, and is valid for a specified period of time.

  **Issuance:**

  DVROs/ROAHs are issued by a judge after the person seeking protection (the petitioner) files a request in court, serves the opposing party, and attends the court set hearing. 

  **Duration:**

  If granted, a DVRO/ROAH can last up to 5 years, after which it can be renewed if necessary.

  **Availability:** 

  DVROs are issued during/after a hearing held during court hours. ROAHs are issued by a judge after the person seeking protection (the petitioner) attends the DVRO hearing following service of the court documents on the opposing party.

  **Notice:**

  The other party must be served with a copy of the court papers and given an opportunity to respond before the DVRO/ROAH hearing.

subject: |
  **Civil Harassment Restraining Orders** (CHRO)
content: |
  **Purpose:**

  A Civil Harassment Restraining Order (CHRO) is a court order designed to protect individuals from harassment, stalking, or threats by someone who is not a family member or an intimate partner. It is intended to safeguard people from abuse or violence by neighbors, roommates, coworkers, or more distant acquaintances.

  **Issuance:**

  A CHRO is issued by a judge after the person seeking protection (the petitioner) files a request in court. The petitioner must provide evidence of harassment, and the judge will determine whether a CHRO is warranted based on the presented information.

  **Duration:**

  If granted, a CHRO can last up to three years, and it can be extended if necessary. The duration may vary depending on the circumstances of the case and the judge’s discretion.

  **Availability:**

  CHROs can be obtained during court hours, and the petitioner typically needs to appear in court to request one. A hearing will be scheduled for both parties to present their case before the judge makes a decision.

  **Notice:**

  The person being restrained (the other party) must be served with a copy of the court papers and given an opportunity to respond before the CHRO hearing.

template: earo_explanation
subject: |
  **Elder Abuse** (or Dependent Adult) **Restraining Order** (EARO)
content: |
  **Purpose:**

  A Dependent Adult or Elder Abuse Restraining Order (EARO) is a court order designed to protect elderly individuals (65 years or older) or dependent adults (18-64 years old with certain disabilities) from abuse, neglect, or exploitation. It offers protection from physical, emotional, or financial harm caused by a family member, caregiver, or any other person responsible for his/her care.

  **Issuance:**

  An EARO is issued by a judge after the person seeking protection (the petitioner), or someone acting on his/her behalf, files a request in court. The petitioner must provide evidence of abuse or neglect, and the judge will determine whether an EARO is warranted based on the presented information.

  **Duration:**

  If granted, an EARO can last up to five years, and it can be extended if necessary. The duration may vary depending on the circumstances of the case and the judge’s discretion.

  **Availability:**

  EAROs can be obtained during court hours, and the petitioner or their representative typically needs to appear in court to request one. A hearing will be scheduled for both parties to present their case before the judge makes a decision.

  **Notice:**

  The person being restrained (the other party) must be served with a copy of the court papers and given an opportunity to respond before the EARO hearing.

template: wpvro_explanation
subject: |
  **Workplace Violence Restraining Orders** (WVRO)
content: |
  **Purpose:**

  A Workplace Violence Restraining Order (WVRO) is a court order intended to protect employees from threats, harassment, or violence in their place of work. It is typically requested by an employer on behalf of an employee who is being subjected to these issues, often by another employee or customer.

  **Issuance:**

  A WVRO is issued by a judge after the employer (the petitioner) files a request in court on behalf of the affected employee. The petitioner must provide evidence of the threats, harassment, or violence, and the judge will decide whether a WVRO is justified based on the provided information.

  **Duration:**

  If granted, a WVRO can last up to three years, and it can be extended if necessary. The duration may depend on the circumstances of the case and the judge’s discretion.

  **Availability:**

  WVROs can be obtained during court hours, and the petitioner (the employer or their representative) typically needs to appear in court to request one. A hearing will be scheduled for both parties to present their case before the judge makes a decision.

  **Notice:**

  The person being restrained (the other party) must be served with a copy of the court papers and given an opportunity to respond before the WVRO hearing.

  *If granted,* a TRO can protect you and your loved ones before and up until the date of your hearing on your request for a permanent restraining order.

  Even if a judge doesn’t grant your request for a TRO, you may still be granted a DVRO at your hearing on your request for a permanent restraining order.

  *If granted,* a DVRO/ ROAH can protect you and your loved ones after your hearing for up to 5 years. You may renew your DVRO before it expires, assuming you meet the legal criteria for renewal.
  
  However, at this time, U Do It Legal cannot help you request an:

  - Emergency Protective Order (must be requested by law enforcement),
  - Criminal Protective Order (issued in criminal court),
  - Civil Harassment Restraining Order (we intend to launch these services in 2025 if not sooner),
  - Elder Abuse Restraining Order (we intend to launch these services in 2025 if not sooner), or
  - Workplace Violence Restraining Order (we intend to launch these services in 2025 if not sooner).

  Physical Abuse
content: |
  California Family Code section 6203 defines "abuse" as it relates to Domestic Violence Restraining Orders. Physical abuse is included within the broader definition of "abuse" in this section. Family Code section 6203 states:

  (a) For purposes of this act, “abuse” means any of the following:

  - (1) To intentionally or recklessly cause or attempt to cause bodily injury.
  - (2) Sexual assault.
  - (3) To place a person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to that person or to another.
  - (4) To engage in any behavior that has been or could be enjoined pursuant to Section 6320.

  (b) Abuse is not limited to the actual infliction of physical injury or assault.

  This definition means that physical abuse, as it relates to DVROs, includes intentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury to another person. Bodily injury refers to any physical harm inflicted upon a person, such as cuts, bruises, or fractures.

While the Family Code does not explicitly define "verbal abuse" or "emotional abuse," it does include "disturbing the peace of the other party" as a form of behavior that can be restrained.

  "Disturb[ing] the peace of the other party" is defined under Family Code section 6320(c) as: 

  “...conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, destroys the mental or emotional calm of the other party. This conduct may be committed directly or indirectly, including through the use of a third party, and by any method or through any means including, but not limited to, telephone, online accounts, text messages, internet-connected devices, or other electronic technologies. This conduct includes, but is not limited to, **coercive control**, which is a pattern of behavior that in purpose or effect unreasonably interferes with a person’s free will and personal liberty."

  Sexual Abuse and Reproductive Coercion
content: |
  **@Ryan, I am currently having Brandon draft legal briefs with citations to potentially replace this text, per your comments on the Roadmap document**
  
  In the context of Domestic Violence Restraining Orders (DVROs), California Family Code section 6320 addresses various behaviors that can be restrained, including sexual assault.

  While the Family Code does not provide a specific definition of "sexual abuse" for the purpose of DVROs, it does refer to "sexually assaulting" as a behavior that can be restrained. Generally, sexual abuse can be understood as non-consensual sexual acts or behaviors, including, but not limited to, sexual assault, rape, or any form of unwanted sexual contact or coercion.

  Sexual assault is defined under California's Penal Code, specifically in sections 261-269. In California, the term "sexual assault" is often used interchangeably with "rape." According to Penal Code section 261, rape is defined as non-consensual sexual intercourse with a person accomplished by means of force, violence, duress, menace, fear, or fraud. The law also considers sexual intercourse without consent, when the victim is incapacitated or incapable of giving consent, as rape.

  California Family Code does not specifically define "financial abuse" in the context of Domestic Violence Restraining Orders (DVROs). However, financial abuse can be considered a form of abuse that could be addressed through restraining orders.

  In some cases, financial abuse can be considered a form of "disturbing the peace of the other party" under California Family Code section 6320(a) and (c)(3), which defines one example of “coercive control” as, "Controlling, regulating, or monitoring the other party’s… finances, economic resources, or access to services.”

  Stalking or Cyberstalking
content: |
  **@Ryan, I am currently having Brandon draft legal briefs with citations to potentially replace this text, per your comments on the Roadmap document**
  
  In the context of DVROs, restraining orders can be issued to protect victims from stalking and cyberstalking behaviors, as they are considered forms of abuse that disturb the peace of the other party. For example, California Family Code section 6320(a) includes "stalking" as a behavior that can be restrained.

  While the Family Code does not explicitly define "stalking" or "cyberstalking," they can be understood through California Penal Code section 646.9, which defines stalking as:

  "Any person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows or willfully and maliciously harasses another person and who makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for his or her safety, or the safety of his or her immediate family is guilty of the crime of stalking."

  California Penal Code section 646.9 was amended in the late 1990s by changing the definition of credible threats to include “electronically communicated threats.” While "cyberstalking" is a term that is not explicitly defined under California law, it is used more broadly to refer to stalking that occurs electronically, such as through emails, text messages, social media, or other online platforms.  It involves the same willful, malicious, and repeated behavior as stalking but occurs in the digital space.

For example, California Family Code section 6320(a) includes "destroying personal property" as a behavior that can be restrained.

  While the Family Code does not explicitly define the "destruction of personal property," it generally refers to intentionally damaging, breaking, or vandalizing another person's belongings.

  How Does California Law Define *Victims* of Domestic Violence?
subquestion: |
  Family Code section 6203 defines “Domestic Violence” as “abuse perpetrated against any of the following persons:

  - A spouse or former spouse
  - A cohabitant or former cohabitant... whose relationship to you was more than purely as a roommate
  - A person with whom the respondent is having or has had a dating or engagement relationship
  - A person with whom the respondent has had a child
  - A child of a party
  - Any other person related by consanguinity or affinity within the second degree.” 

  ${prog_disclose(ca_law_victims_explanation)}
  
  Your relationship to the other party must fall under at least one of the categories above to qualify to file a Request for DVRO in California.

  DVRO Cases from Start to Finish
subquestion: |
  #####**Step 1: Filing**
  
  Filing for a restraining order involves completing the necessary court forms and submitting them to the court. This is the first step in requesting legal protection from the person causing harm. We will help you understand and complete the required forms in the following interviews.
  
  "Filing" refers to the process of submitting your legal documents or forms to the court, typically through the court clerk. This action officially registers your case with the court system. It's a crucial step in most legal processes, whether you are starting a case or responding to one. 
  
  Think of it as officially handing in your paperwork, just like you would turn in an application or form in other settings. We go over step-by-step instructions on how to file your court forms in your "Part 4, Next Steps" interview.
  
  Once you've filed your initial set of paperwork, the clerk will give all your forms to the judge. The judge will read your papers and decide on whether to grant the orders you are asking for under a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). By law, the judge must decide by the next business day, but the exact time varies from court to court.

  Not necessarily. Most TRO requests can be made without telling the other party that you are doing so. However, once the TRO is granted, the other party must be "served" with a copy of the order before the hearing for a long-term restraining order. Read “Serving the Other Party” below for more information about service.

  DVRO Cases from Start to Finish
subquestion: |
  #####**Step 2: Serving the Other Party**

  After filing your restraining order request and any related court forms, the other party must be formally given or "served" with the court papers. This is an important step that ensures the person causing harm is aware of the restraining order and the upcoming court hearing. 
  
  "Service" in a legal context means delivering legal documents to another party in a case. The goal of service is to notify this party about the legal proceedings and give them a chance to respond. In other words, it is like an official, legally recognized delivery of important paperwork that keeps everyone informed about what's going on in a case. We will explain how to correctly serve the papers in detail in your “Part 4, Next Steps” interview.

  DVRO Cases from Start to Finish
subquestion: |
  #####**Step 3: The Other Party's Response**
  
  Once the other party (also known as the "Respondent") has been served with the restraining order, he or she can file a document known as the "Response" to present their side of the story. In this document, he or she can agree with or disagree with the orders requested by the person seeking protection (the "Petitioner"), and can also request orders of their own. For instance, the other party might ask for child visitation rights or a change in the proposed contact restrictions. 
  
  Further, the other party can ask the court to postpone (or "continue") the hearing. This might be because he or she needs more time to find a lawyer or prepare their case. Remember, just like the Petitioner, the other party's requests are not automatically granted. The judge will carefully consider all the information and make a decision at the hearing.

  Understanding Your Employment Protections: What Employment Rights Exist for Domestic Violence Victims in California?
content: |
  **Domestic Violence Victim Leave**
  
  [California Labor Code section 230](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=230.&lawCode=LAB) provides important employment protections for victims of domestic violence. If you work for an employer with **more than 25 employees**, you have the right to take domestic violence victim leave. This allows you time off work to address various matters related to the domestic violence, such as:
  
  - obtaining temporary restraining orders, 
  - seeking medical or mental health treatment, or 
  - finding safety in a domestic violence shelter.

  **Notifying the Employer** 
  
  To exercise your right to domestic violence leave, you need to notify your employer within a reasonable time of your intended leave, unless advance notice is not feasible. 
  
  **Right to Reasonable Accommodation**
  
  Once you provide notice, your employer is required to provide "reasonable accommodation" during your time off. This can include:
  
  - changing your work schedule, 
  - installing locks on your door, 
  - changing work telephone numbers, 
  - transferring you to a different job or location, or 
  - implementing other changes that help protect your safety at work.

  **No Retaliation or Discrimination**
  
  It's important to note that your employer is prohibited from retaliating against you or treating you differently as a result of taking domestic violence leave. They cannot wrongfully terminate your employment, fail to promote you, harass you, or discriminate against you based on your leave.

  If you believe your employer has violated these protections, you can file a complaint with the California Labor Commissioner's Office. Employment attorneys experienced in this area can guide you through the process and help protect your rights.

  Why might the court need to hold multiple hearings?
content: |
  In a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) case, the court may need to hold multiple hearings if certain additional orders are requested, such as child custody, visitation, or support orders.

  Here's why: these orders involve complex issues that often require more detailed investigation and consideration. For instance, if you are asking for child custody or visitation orders, the court needs to ensure that any decisions made are in the best interests of the child or children. This often involves considering documentary evidence, hearing testimony from both parties and others, and sometimes, obtaining reports from child welfare professionals.

  Similarly, decisions on child support or spousal support orders involve reviewing the financial circumstances of both parties. The court needs to ensure that any order made is fair and in line with California's guidelines for support and applicable law.

  Move-Out Orders

  If you share a home or residence with the other party, move-out orders can make the person causing harm move out of your shared home, typically in the presence of law enforcement. This allows only you to access the home, hopefully reducing fear and making your home a safer space for you and others.

  Child Custody and Visitation (Parenting Time) Orders
content: |
  If you and the other party have minor children together, child custody and visitation orders can help you by setting up rules for who takes care of your children, and when the other party can visit the child/children. This helps to ensure the safety and well-being of your children. If you request child custody and visitation orders in your case, you may be ordered to attend mediation prior to your hearing.

  Child Custody Mediation
content: |
  Mediators work for the courts and help parents make parenting plans that are good for the children. Mediators know how to work with separated couples, and they are trained to understand domestic violence. If you are worried about your safety or your children's safety, you may tell the mediator. You can also ask to speak with the mediator alone, as you have a right to meet separately with the mediator in cases involving alleged domestic violence. You can also bring a support person with you to mediation and mediation orientation.

  [California Penal Code Section 278.7](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=278.7.&lawCode=PEN) States:
  
  278.7. Exception; belief of bodily injury or emotional harm; report by person taking or concealing child; confidentiality
  
  - (a) Section 278.5 does not apply to a person with a right to custody of a child who, with a good faith and reasonable belief that the child, if left with the other parent, will suffer immediate bodily injury or emotional harm, takes, entices away, keeps, withholds, or conceals that child.
  - (b) Section 278.5 does not apply to a person with a right to custody of a child who has been a victim of domestic violence who, with a good faith and reasonable belief that the child, if left with the other person, will suffer immediate bodily injury or emotional harm, takes, entices away, keeps, withholds, or conceals that child. “Emotional harm” includes having a parent who has committed domestic violence against the parent who is taking, enticing away, keeping, withholding, or concealing the child.
  - (c) The person who takes, entices away, keeps, withholds, or conceals a child shall do all of the following: (1) Within a reasonable time from the taking, enticing away, keeping, withholding, or concealing, make a report to the office of the district attorney of the county where the child resided before the action. The report shall include the name of the person, the current address and telephone number of the child and the person, and the reasons the child was taken, enticed away, kept, withheld, or concealed. (2) Within a reasonable time from the taking, enticing away, keeping, withholding, or concealing, commence a custody proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (Section 1738A, Title 28, United States Code) or the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (Part 3 (commencing with Section 3400) of Division 8 of the Family Code). (3) Inform the district attorney’s office of any change of address or telephone number of the person and the child.
  - (d) For the purposes of this article, a reasonable time within which to make a report to the district attorney’s office is at least 10 days and a reasonable time to commence a custody proceeding is at least 30 days. This section shall not preclude a person from making a report to the district attorney’s office or commencing a custody proceeding earlier than those specified times.
  - (e) The address and telephone number of the person and the child provided pursuant to this section shall remain confidential unless released pursuant to state law or by a court order that contains appropriate safeguards to ensure the safety of the person and the child.

  What does this mean in more simple terms? 
content: |
  This law states that if you have a legal right to custody of a child and you believe, in good faith and with reason, that the child could face immediate physical harm or emotional distress if left with the other parent, you are allowed to take or conceal the child. This also applies to you as an alleged victim of domestic violence if you believe that leaving the child with the other party might lead to the child’s immediate harm or distress. Emotional harm can also mean a situation where the other party has committed domestic violence against you that adversely affects you emotionally, and you decide to take or hide the child.

  **However, if you take or hide a child under these circumstances, you are required to do the following:**

  - Report to the district attorney’s office in the county where the child lived before you took or concealed them. You should do this within a reasonable time, sharing your name, the child’s current address and phone number, and your reasons for taking or hiding the child.
  - Start a legal process to obtain custody of the child, such as requesting custody and visitation orders through your request for domestic violence restraining orders. You should do this in a court that has jurisdiction and is in line with federal law, such as the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act or the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. This should be done within a reasonable time from when you took or hid the child.
  - Keep the district attorney’s office updated with any changes in your address or phone number, as well as the child’s.

  Under the California Penal Code section 278.7(d), a "reasonable time" to report to the district attorney's office is considered to be at least 10 days. A "reasonable time" to start a custody proceeding is at least 30 days. However, you can choose to do these things sooner.

  Lastly, your address and phone number, and the child’s, that you provide during this process will stay confidential. It can only be disclosed according to state law or by a court order that has necessary safeguards to protect your and the child’s safety.

  Safety Planning 
subquestion: |
  #####Importance of a Safety Plan
  
  Having a safety plan is crucial for your well-being during a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) case. This plan is your personalized guide, designed to increase your safety and that of your loved ones in situations of domestic violence.

  Your safety plan takes into account your specific risks and needs. It covers various scenarios, from providing strategies for escalating situations, steps for emergencies, to ensuring your safety after leaving an abusive environment. It will help you identify your emergency contacts, secure necessary documents, plan safe places to go, and even help you maintain your mental and emotional health during this challenging time.

  Remember, your safety plan's main goal is to guide and support you during intense or frightening situations, giving you confidence in making decisions. It's an essential tool to help you take control of your situation as you navigate through this DVRO process. Always prioritize your safety and do not hesitate to seek help when you need it.

  As you begin your case, you will find yourself navigating a complex legal landscape. This process may involve various considerations that can affect your overall experience and the outcomes of your case. 
  
  To help you better understand and prepare for this journey, the following pages discuss three crucial factors you may encounter: cost, conflict level, and the professionals who may become involved in your case. 
  
  Each of these elements has its nuances, and understanding them can help you to better navigate the DVRO process and plan for the road ahead.

  Additional Considerations to Keep in Mind: Cost
subquestion: |
  #####**Cost**
  
  Understanding what the legal process can and might cost is crucial, especially when representing yourself in a DVRO case in California. While the goal is to ensure your safety and well-being, it is also important to plan for the potential costs involved. This way, you can navigate the legal process confidently and focus on protecting yourself and your family. 
  
  Below, we break down some of the common and potential costs you might incur in a DVRO case, from waived filing fees to service fees, and even considerations like time off work or childcare. Remember, each case is unique, and actual costs can vary based on individual circumstances.
  
  ${prog_disclose(filing_fees)}
  ${prog_disclose(process_server_fees)}
  ${prog_disclose(attorneys_fees)}
  ${prog_disclose(indirect_costs)}
  
  Lastly, remember that the cost of not taking action could be much greater in the long run. While it is essential to consider these financial aspects, the primary focus in a DVRO case should always be your safety and well-being.

template: filing_fees
subject: |
  Filing Fees
content: |
  In a DVRO case, you will not typically have to worry about filing fees. California law waives these fees for individuals seeking a Domestic Violence Restraining Order, recognizing the urgent need for these protections. In other words, you should not have to pay to file court documents requesting a domestic violence restraining order in California. 
---
template: process_server_fees
subject: |
  Service Fees
content: |
  You may incur costs related to serving the court papers, which is the legal term for officially delivering these documents to the other party. There are several ways to serve documents. While some are free, others have associated costs. 
  
  - You could ask a friend or family member over 18 to serve the papers at no cost. However, the person serving the court paperwork must not be involved in the case, and will need to be at the hearing to tell the judge that he/she served the papers and how service was done. 
  - Alternatively, you could use the local sheriff's office, which usually provides this service for free or for a small fee in DVRO cases. 
  - If you choose to hire a professional process server, there will be a fee involved, and this cost can vary depending on the provider.

  Attorney's Fees
content: |
  While you’ve chosen to represent yourself in this case using U Do It Legal, be mindful that the other party in the case might hire an attorney. In some circumstances, the court may order one party to pay all or a portion of the other party’s attorney’s fees. Attorney's fees are generally awarded only to the party that “prevails” in (i.e., wins) the case, with the court also taking into consideration the difference in income or financial resources between the two parties.
---
template: indirect_costs
subject: |
  Indirect Costs
content: |
  Additionally, consider potential indirect costs. For instance, you might need to take time off work to prepare your case or attend court. You might also need childcare during these times. And while you will not have the cost of an attorney, you may want to budget for potential consultation fees with a legal professional to guide you through the process.
---
question: |
  Additional Considerations to Keep in Mind: Conflict Level
subquestion: |
  #####**Conflict Level**
  
  DVRO cases can vary greatly in terms of conflict levels, ranging from relatively amicable situations where both parties agree on most issues, to highly contentious circumstances where almost every aspect of the case is disputed. 
  
  Navigating these conflict levels while self-representing can be challenging, but understanding what to expect can help prepare you for the journey ahead. We explore the different types of conflict you may encounter during your DVRO case below. Each scenario is unique and will require a different approach.
  
  ${prog_disclose(low_conflict)}
  ${prog_disclose(medium_conflict)}
  ${prog_disclose(high_conflict)}
  ${prog_disclose(unknown_conflict)}
  
  Remember, navigating a DVRO case can be complicated and emotionally draining. No matter the level of conflict, ensure that your physical safety and emotional well-being are prioritized. Reach out for support when necessary and stay informed about your rights and options.

template: low_conflict
subject: |
  Low Conflict
content: |
  **Low Conflict:** In some DVRO cases, the situation may be relatively low conflict. This typically happens when the other party agrees to and is compliant with the orders made, understands the seriousness of their actions, and is willing to adhere to the orders imposed by the court. He or she may also agree with the requests filed by the petitioner, reducing the need for contentious hearings or ongoing legal battles. However, even in low conflict situations, it’s important to remain vigilant and prepared. Unexpected situations may arise, so maintaining open communication with the court is crucial.
---
template: medium_conflict
subject: |
  Medium Conflict
content: |
  **Medium Conflict:**  In medium conflict situations, the other party might partially agree with some of the requests filed, but dispute others. He or she might contest requested orders relating to visitation, property control, or other requested orders. These scenarios often require more negotiation when attempting settlement, and may result in multiple court appearances. Remember that every detail you provide—evidence of abuse, records of interactions, pictures, etc.—can influence the judge’s decisions. Be prepared to substantiate your claims and stand your ground in these situations.
---
template: high_conflict
subject: |
  High Conflict
content: |
  **High Conflict:** In high conflict situations, the other party may resist all requested orders, any restraining order issued, deny allegations, or even retaliate with their own legal action against you or others. These cases can be extremely stressful and may involve prolonged court battles. Legal counsel or advice from a lawyer can be particularly beneficial in these instances. U Do It Legal urges individuals to hire an attorney rather than relying solely on our services in these situations. Always prioritize your safety; if you fear escalation or violent reactions from the person against whom you request a restraining order, consider also seeking assistance from law enforcement or a domestic violence hotline. The court can also potentially assist in enforcing any protective order issued to you, and otherwise aiding you in your safety.
---
template: unknown_conflict
subject: |
  Unknown Conflict Level
content: |
  **Unknown Conflict Level:** In some cases, the level of conflict may be unpredictable. The other party’s reactions might vary, or he or she may become more confrontational over time. In these cases, be prepared for any eventuality. Courts recommend keeping records of all interactions between you and the party from whom you seek protection, and ensuring that you have a safety plan in place. Don’t hesitate to seek professional advice or assistance from local law enforcement, local resources, and organizations when needed.

  #####**Professionals**
  
  During the course of a DVRO case, you may encounter several professionals from various fields who play vital roles in the legal proceedings, your safety, and overall wellbeing. Each has a unique responsibility and purpose within the justice system and beyond. Understanding their roles can help you navigate the process more smoothly and effectively. Here's a quick overview of the key players you might interact with:

  The court clerk is often your first point of contact within the judicial system (that is, unless you say hello to the security guards at the front of the courthouse). Court clerks handle administrative duties in the court, including receiving and filing your court documents, and work directly with the judge. Clerks can answer basic questions about forms and procedures but cannot give legal advice. Always be courteous and polite with the court clerk.

  Family Law Facilitator / Custody Mediator
content: |
  A family law facilitator is a lawyer who works for the court to assist self-representing litigants with their cases, particularly in matters related to family law. They can help you understand court procedures and prepare your forms, but Family Law Facilitators cannot represent you in court.

  A custody mediator, on the other hand, is trained to assist in resolving disputes related to child custody and visitation. If child custody and visitation orders are being requested in a DVRO proceeding, a child custody mediator may be appointed by the court to help you and the other party reach a mutually beneficial agreement regarding any minor children you have together.

  Judge / Judicial Officer
content: |
  The judge (or occasionally a judicial officer) is the ultimate authority in the courtroom. The judge presides over hearings, makes decisions based on the law and the evidence presented, and issues court orders. In a DVRO case, the judge will decide whether to grant the restraining order and determine any additional orders to be made in connection with the restraining order.

  Law Enforcement 
content: |
  Law enforcement officers (aka police officers) play an essential role in enforcing court orders. If a temporary restraining order (TRO) or permanent restraining order (DVRO/ROAH) is granted, local law enforcement agencies are typically notified. Law enforcement can enforce the order and may intervene and arrest the other party if the order is violated.
  
  Additionally, many sheriff's departments will serve local restraining orders onto the other party for free or for a small fee in DVRO cases.

  Some organizations that render services to support survivors of domestic violence can provide you with an advocate who will accompany you to court hearings upon your request. Note, however, that advocates who offer court accompaniment are there for emotional support and cannot speak in court on your behalf.

We needed practical tools to keep people safe in the digital age, but couldn’t find any. So we created resources specifically for organizations that help victims and communities stay safe - and discovered you don’t need to be a tech wizard to address online abuse.   

  Here’s how it works: Schedule a call to see how we can help, host a staff training or community presentation and immediately start addressing digital safety in your community. 

  Our goal is simple: We want to help you start preventing and reducing online harm and become the digital safety resource you community needs to survive and thrive in the digital age.

  If you are a victim of domestic violence or live with a victim of domestic violence, there is a special program called Safe At Home for which you can apply. It is a free program that helps you keep your address private.

  The California Secretary of State’s website describes the Safe at Home program as “a confidential address program administered by the California Secretary of State's office and is most effective when used as a part of an overall safety plan. Safe at Home offers victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, human trafficking & elder and dependent abuse, a substitute mailing address to receive first class, certified, and registered mail. This address is also accepted by California state, county, and city government agencies in lieu of a residential or other mailing address where a victim can be tracked down, keeping the residence address confidential and out of the hands of someone who might want to harm the victim.”
