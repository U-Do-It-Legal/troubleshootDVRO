Make sure that the checked boxes correspond to the orders checked on your DV-100 form. Please note that the list of orders below is not an exhaustive list of orders that you can request in a DVRO proceeding, and may not include all of the orders you have requested.

  - Spousal (or Partner) Support: requesting_spousalsupport
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      **Item 25 on DV-100.** Spousal Support (aka, Partner Support or Alimony) is a regular payment from one spouse to another.

  - Child Custody and Visitation: requesting_custody
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      **Item 15 on DV-100.** Child Custody refers to the rights and responsibilities between parents for taking care of their children. Visitation (aka parenting time) refers to how and when each parent will spend time with the children.
  - Supervised Visitation: requesting_supervisedvisitation
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      **Item 11 on DV-105, Request for Child Custody and Visitation Orders.** Supervised Visitation is most often ordered when a parent, in this case the other party, is determined to present a risk to the children’s safety or well-being, warranting the presence of a third party to supervise visits with the other parent. This third party can be a friend, relative, or a professional monitor.
  - Child Abduction Prevention Orders: requesting_childabduction

    help: |
      **Check this box if you completed interview Part 3.3/form DV-160, the Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential from the Public.** The Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential from the Public orders ensure that certain information about minors is not included in the public court record, safeguarding their privacy and security. This means that specific details related to minors, such as their names, addresses, and other identifying information, are not accessible to the general public. 
  - Debt (Bill) Payment: requesting_debtpayment
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      **Item 22 on DV-100.** Under Debt Payment orders, the court can order ${resp.name.first} to pay certain debts related to property that you both own or rent, such as mortgage payments, utility bills, or other shared financial obligations.

  - Property Control: requesting_propertycontrol
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      **Item 17 on DV-100.** Property Control orders can give you temporary control over certain property that you and ${resp.name.first} own or rent. For instance, you may be granted exclusive control over a vehicle, a home, a smartphone, or other shared assets, regardless of who the property is technically registered to.
  - Property Restraint: requesting_propertyrestraint
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      **Item 20 on DV-100.** Note, you can only request Property Restraint orders if you and ${resp.name} are currently married or registered domestic partners. Property Restraint orders protect your property by prohibiting ${resp.name.first}, from disposing, damaging, or transferring it without the court's permission. 
  - Transfer of Wireless Phone Account(s): requesting_wirelesstransfer
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      **Item 28 on DV-100.** If ${resp.name.first} holds the rights to your or your child's cell phone account, the judge can order that your wireless service provider transfer the ownership of these accounts to you. Note, this means you will be financially responsible for these accounts.

subject: |
  What if the court is closed when I want to file? 
content: |
   The court is only typically open on weekdays between 8:30 AM and 4:30 PM (though ${court_name}'s hours may vary). If the court is closed and you need a restraining order immediately, take your court forms/documents to your local police station. They can help you apply for a restraining order right away. 
   
   The Probation department may find out if ${resp.name.first} has a criminal history. They will also find out if ${resp.name.first}  has any other restraining orders. They will give this information to the judge.

template: printing_options
subject: |
  What if I don't have a printer/copier?
content: |
  If you do not have access to a personal printer or copy machine, here are a few options you may use to print your court documents: 
  
  **Local Courthouse:** Visit your local courthouse and check if they have a law library or self-help center. Many courthouses provide public access to computers and printers, allowing you to print your court forms securely. Additionally, these facilities often have staff available who can assist you in preparing and making copies of your forms for filing.

  **Public Libraries:** Public libraries often offer computer workstations and printing services. Check with your local library to see if they provide access to computers and printers for public use. Ensure that you follow their privacy guidelines and take necessary precautions to protect your sensitive information.

  **Community Centers:** Some community centers or nonprofit organizations may offer computer and printing facilities for public use. Reach out to these centers in your area to inquire about their available resources and any associated costs.

  **Print Shops and Copy Centers:** Commercial print shops and copy centers are an option for printing court forms. Some examples of commercial print shops around California are FedEx Office, the UPS Store, Office Depot/OfficeMax, Staples, and local printing companies. However, exercise caution when using these services, as they are not specifically designed for handling sensitive legal documents. Before using a print shop or copy center, ensure that they can maintain the confidentiality and privacy of your information. 

  **Friends, Family, or Trusted Contacts:** If you have friends, family members, or trusted contacts who have access to a printer, you can ask for their assistance in printing your court forms. Make sure to only share your documents with individuals you trust and consider taking precautions to protect your privacy.

  **Step 3. Check Court Filing Requirements**
  
  Any individual who files court forms and other documents with the court is required to comply with the rules governing filing. While U Do It Legal strives to provide accurate and up-to-date information  that relate to its various services, as to the final preparation and filing of your court forms/documents, we highly recommend and consider it essential for you to review the California Rules of Court, specifically Rules 2.100-2.119, and visit the California Court website's [Basics of Court forms](https://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-forms.htm) page. Pay special attention to the section titled "Tips for Filling Out Judicial Council Forms" to ensure that your completed forms adhere to the latest court standards for filing. Note that per Rule 2.100(c), papers that are submitted or filed electronically must meet the requirements in [Rule 2.256(b)](https://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=two&linkid=rule2_256).
  
  Your attentiveness in reviewing and verifying that your court forms/documents comply comply with the latest court standards is essential.

  **Step 4. Make copies of your forms**
  
  Make at least 2 copies of your completed and signed court forms. To be clear, you'll need 3 sets in total:
  
  - The original court documents with your signatures (in blue or black ink)
  - At Least 2 copies of the original court documents. The court will keep the original forms and return the 2, file-stamped copies to you

  #####Filing Your Forms in the Courthouse

  **Step 1. Locating the Clerk's Office:** 
  
  Once you arrive at the courthouse, the Clerk's Office is usually located on the ground floor. However, courthouses vary in design, so if it's not immediately evident, look for signs or directories that might guide you. The Clerk's Office is where most legal documents are filed and processed. Note that some court’s may have multiple clerk offices that are dedicated to a particular area of law, e.g., Family Law, Probate, General Civil.

  **Step 5. Conformed/Endorsed (Stamped) Copies:** 
  
  After the clerk reviews your forms, they will keep the original and return copies to you. They will "conform/endorse" these copies, by either physically stamping a copy, or by providing you a computerized court endorsement on the copy, showing your documents have been filed. Make sure you have these copies before leaving the office.
  
  Remember, while this is a stressful time, everyone in the courthouse is there to facilitate the court process, from the security officers to the clerks. Don't be afraid to ask for assistance or clarification if you need it.

  If you do not speak English well, ask the court clerk for an interpreter. The clerk may ask you to complete a request form if you want to have an interpreter at the hearing. If the court cannot give you an interpreter, bring an adult to interpret or you. Do not ask a witness in your case or a child involved in your case to interpret for you.

  Note on Filing Fees
content: |
  [Family Code section 6222](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&sectionNum=6222.) states, "There is no filing fee for an application, a responsive pleading, or an order to show cause that seeks to obtain, modify, or enforce a protective order or other order authorized by this division when the request for the other order is necessary to obtain or give effect to a protective order. There is no fee for a subpoena filed in connection with that application, responsive pleading, or order to show cause. There is no fee for any filings related to a petition filed pursuant to Part 4 (commencing with 6300) of this division."
  
  In other words, **you are not required to pay a filing fee to file your Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order's initial court documents**, which are the same documents you have prepared in previous interviews.

question: |
  Next, find out if the judge issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)
subquestion: |
  The clerk will give all your court forms/documents to the judge. The judge will read your papers and decide whether to grant the orders for which you are asking. By law, the judge must decide by the next business day, but the exact time varies from court to court.

  The judge may want to ask you questions or request that you provide more information in writing in support of your request. The clerk will tell you what, if anything, the judge requests. If the judge wants to talk with you, be prepared to tell the judge why you need a restraining order. Talk about the facts contained in your court forms/documents on which you are basing your request, including any supporting documents you have submitted (e.g., police reports, pictures, texts, emails, etc.)
  
  ${card_start("Note:", color="info")}
  If the judge wants to talk to you, this meeting is called an "ex-parte hearing." The term “ex-parte” indicates that you are seeking temporary emergency orders in a hearing at which ${resp.name.first} is not present. 
  ${card_end()}
continue button field: tro_issuance1

question: |
  What can the judge do? 
subquestion: |
  **At this point, the judge can do 3 things:**

  1.	**Grant all requested orders temporarily:** The judge may grant every order you requested and schedule a hearing. This order is called a Temporary Restraining Order, or TRO, and it is only good until your next hearing. The hearing is usually scheduled in 10 days. 
  2. **Grant some requested orders temporarily:** The judge may grant only some of the orders you requested (as part of a TRO) and schedule a hearing. Note that even if some of the orders you requested were denied in the temporary restraining order, the judge may still grant them as part of a permanent restraining order after the hearing. 
  3.	**Deny all requested orders temporarily:** The judge may decide he or she needs to hear from ${resp.name.first} before issuing any restraining orders. Again, note that the judge may still grant the orders you requested as part of a permanent restraining order after the hearing. 

  The following pages provide more detailed information regarding these potential outcomes.

question: |
  Outcome 1: The Court Grants a Temporary Restraining Order
subquestion: |
  If the judge issues a TRO, he or she may have granted all of the orders you requested in your Request for DVRO (form DV-100). The court will indicate this under Item 4 on form DV-109, the Notice of Court Hearing:
  
  [FILE tro_all_granted, 100%]
  
  Box a(1) will be checked if the judge granted all of the orders you requested
  
  **If the judge decides to grant the Temporary Restraining Order, the court then:**

  1.	Schedules a hearing within 10 business days.
  2.	Orders that ${resp.name.first} be “served” with a copy of the order.
  3.	Sends you a copy of the restraining order, probably by mail. 
  
  Read the Temporary Restraining Order (form DV-110) as soon as you get it. Call the court to fix any mistakes (e.g, an incorrect address is listed for you, the restrained party’s name is misspelled, etc.). You may need to go back in front of the judge to get the order corrected.

  Always keep a copy of the order with you, no matter where you are or the time of day. Show this order to the police if ${resp.name.first} does something that is against the order. Keep extra copies in safe places, such as your car, your work, with your babysitter, your child's doctors, your friend's house, or your parent's house. 

  The court can give you duplicate copies of the order if you lose your or another copy.

  If I have my order, why do I have to go back to court so soon for a hearing?
content: |
  The hearing gives ${resp.name.first} a chance to tell the judge his or her side of the story.

  You must return to court for the hearing if you want the court to keep your restraining order in effect and extend it beyond the time and date stated in the TRO. If you do not appear at the hearing, the court will dismiss the TRO at the hearing.

question: |
  Outcome 2: The Court Grants Some of Your Requested Orders, but Denies Others
subquestion: |
  If the judge issues a TRO, he or she may have granted only some of the orders you requested, while denying others. The court will indicate this under Item 4 on form DV-109, the Notice of Court Hearing:
  
  [FILE tro_some_granted, 100%]
  Box a(3) will be checked if the judge only granted some of the orders you requested, and the reasons he/she gave for denying some of the orders will be listed under section b. Note, the judge may still make the orders you want after your hearing. 
  
  **If the judge decides to grant the Temporary Restraining Order, the court then:**

  1.	Schedules a hearing within 10 business days.
  2.	Orders that ${resp.name.first} be “served” with a copy of the order.
  3.	Sends you a copy of the restraining order, probably by mail. 
  
  Read the Temporary Restraining Order (form DV-110) as soon as you get it. Call the court to fix any mistakes (e.g, an incorrect address is listed for you, the restrained party’s name is misspelled, etc.). You may need to go back in front of the judge to get the order corrected.

  Outcome 3: The Court Denies a Temporary Restraining Order 
subquestion: |
  If the judge denied all of the temporary restraining orders you requested until the court hearing, box a(2) will be checked under Item 4 on form DV-109, the Notice of Court Hearing. 
  
  [FILE tro_all_denied, 100%]
  Note, the judge may still make the orders you want after hearing from both sides at the hearing. You can keep the hearing date, or you can cancel your request for orders so there is no court hearing. 
  
  **If you want to cancel the hearing:**
  
  - Use form DV-112, Waiver of Hearing on Denied Request for Temporary Restraining Order. Complete and file it with the court as soon as possible. You may still file a new request for DVRO on the same or different facts at a later time. 
  - Do not serve any documents on/to ${resp.name}. 
  
  **If you want to keep the hearing date:** 
  
  - You must have all the documents listed in Item 6 on form DV-109 served on/to ${resp.name} by the deadline for service. 
  - At your hearing, the judge will consider whether denial of any requested orders will jeopardize your safety and the safety of any other individuals for whom you are seeking protection. 
  
  You must attend the hearing if you want the judge to make permanent restraining orders regardless of the judge denying the issuance of a TRO. If you cancel or do not attend the hearing, your request for a restraining order will not be considered any further by the court.

question: |
  Next, "Serve" Your Court Forms on to ${resp.name.first}
subquestion: |
  #####What is Service?
  
  “Service” means that an independent third party (i.e., an individual other than you) must personally hand ${resp.name.first} conformed/endorsed copies of the court forms and documents you submitted and that the court ordered to be served on to ${resp.name.first}. 
  
  Until ${resp.name.first} has been properly “served,” your Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) is not enforceable against ${resp.name.first}, and the judge cannot make any permanent orders (i.e., grant your request for DVRO) at the scheduled hearing.

question: |
  Options for Service
subquestion: |
  #####Server Requirements:
  
  The server must:
    
  - **Be 18 years old or older,** &
  - **NOT be protected by any TRO that has been issued in this case,** &
  - **NOT be a person who you are asking the court to protect under a permanent restraining order** (i.e. the server cannot be party to the case)
  
  #####Summary of Your Options for Service:
  
  - You could ask a friend or family member 18 or over to serve the papers at no cost. However, the person serving the court paperwork must not be involved in the case, and he or she will need to be at the hearing to tell the judge that he/she served the papers and how service was done. 
  - Alternatively, you could use the local sheriff's office, which usually provides this service for free or for a small fee in DVRO cases. 
  - If you choose to hire a professional process server, there will be a fee involved, and this cost can vary depending on the provider. The judge will decide whether he/she needs to hear from the process server regarding how service was done.

  Process Servers
content: |
  You can also hire a “process server,” which is a business you hire for a fee serve/deliver court forms/documents. You do not need to hire a process server, but make sure that whoever you have serve ${resp.name.first} meets the requirements bolded above and signs the proof of service confirming how, when, and where ${resp.name.first} was served.
  
  The cost of hiring a process server in California can vary depending on several factors, including the location, complexity of the case, urgency of service, and the specific requirements of the task. Process servers in California typically charge a flat fee for each service attempt or a fee based on the number of documents to be served.

  On average, process serving fees in California can range from $40 to $150 per service attempt. However, keep in mind that these figures are approximate and can vary significantly. Complex cases, rush services, or serving documents in remote areas may incur higher fees. It's recommended to contact several process servers in your area to get accurate quotes based on your specific needs.

  Service by Your Local Sheriff's Office
content: |  
  Check to see if your local sheriff will serve the other party for you. In domestic violence cases, a law enforcement officer may be able to serve your restraining order papers for you. If they do, they will do it for free or for a small fee. 
  
  Remember, if granted, your TRO does not go into effect (start working) until ${resp.name.first} is served with a copy. The sheriff/police should tell you when they have given ${resp.name.first} the order. Check with the sheriff/police if you do not hear from them within a day. 

  The sheriff/police will also stay at your home until ${resp.name.first} leaves if the order requires ${resp.name.first} to leave your home (i.e., if the judge grants a Move-Out order).

  If ${resp.name.first} needs to get personal belongings from the home, he or she can arrange to do that with the sheriff/police to return to the home when you are not present, and take only personal belongings needed, like clothes, work/personal computer, medications, and the like.

question: |
  Steps for Service
subquestion: |
  #####**Step 1:** Determine by when you must serve your court forms/documents:
  
  You will have to serve the court forms/documents ordered by the judge for service on ${resp.name.first} by the deadline the judge indicates on your papers. This is so ${resp.name.first} is provided the required amount of time to respond to your papers and prepare for court. To find the court forms/documents ordered to be served and your deadline for service:
  
  - Look at your court date on page 1 of Form DV-109, the Notice of Court Hearing
  - Look at the number of days written or checked in item 6 on page 2 of form DV-109 and also check which forms are checked under item 6, as you will need to have each of those documents served on ${resp.name.first}.
  - Subtract the number of days in item 5 from the court date. That is your deadline to serve your papers. You can always serve before the deadline. If nothing is written in section 6, you must have your court papers served at least 5 days before your court date.
  
  We recommend that you write down, set a reminder, or mark this date on your calendar to ensure timely completion of service before the deadline.

question: |
  Steps for Service
subquestion: |
  #####**Step 2:** Serve Your Papers on ${resp.name}:
  
  Have someone “serve” (give/hand deliver) ${resp.name.first} a copy of the court forms/documents that the judge ordered be served on him/her. In addition to serving a copy of your completed and file-stamped court forms/documents, you must also also serve any blank court forms indicated under Item 6 of form DV-109, the Notice of Court Hearing. We have attached blank copies of these forms that you may download at the end of this interview. 
  
  The court forms/documents must be personally handed to ${resp.name.first}. You cannot send them by mail, or have them dropped off with someone else who you think will get them to ${resp.name.first}. If ${resp.name.first} refuses to physically accept the court forms/documents, the server/process server may place them in front her him/her (e.g., on the ground, on a table, or any other place near ${resp.name.first}), and indicate on the proof of service that ${resp.name.first} refused to accept the court forms/documents, but that those court forms/documents were left in her presence.
  
  ${card_start("Note on Blank Forms:", color="info")}
  Do not file blank forms with the court. When you file your forms, the Clerk will give you back 2 "endorsed" (stamped) copies. You must attach the blank forms to the back of the copy that you are having served on/to ${resp.name.first}. Make sure your proof of service identifies that these documents were also served. 
  ${card_end()} 
continue button field: service_step2

question: |
  Steps for Service
subquestion: |
  #####**Step 3:** File Your Proof of Service
  
  Have your server complete and sign the Proof of Personal Service (CLETS) (form DV-200) and give it to you so you can file it with the court. This form tells the judge and the sheriff/police that ${resp.name.first} personally received a copy of the filed court forms/documents that the court ordered served and has been notified of the scheduled hearing and all court orders issued, if any. It is very important your server prepares the Proof of Service correctly. If possible, review it or have it reviewed by someone familiar the rules on service of process before filing to make sure it was prepared properly. 

  #####Instructions:
  
  - Have your server complete the Proof of Service (form DV-200) and return it to you. Ensure that it lists the court forms/documents served, the date and time they were served, where they were served, and the server's signature. 
  - Review the Proof of Service to ensure it is prepared correctly, and make at least 2 copies of the completed Proof of Service (form DV-200).
  - Then, file the original and copies with the court clerk before your hearing. The clerk will keep the original and give you back conformed/endorsed copies stamped or electronically indicated that the proof of service was received and filed by the court. **Take a copy of a conformed/endorsed Proof of Service to your hearing in case the judge does not have the Proof of Service at the hearing.**
  - **ALWAYS keep 1 copy with you (together with your restraining order).** Put the other copies with the Temporary Restraining Order copies you have distributed. 
  
  ${card_start("Note:", color="info")}
  If your server is a law enforcement officer or process server, they may use a different proof of service form. If so, make sure it lists the court forms/documents that were served, the date and time they were served, where they were served, and server's signature. Law enforcement may tell you that they will file the proof of service. Get a copy of the signed proof of service nevertheless so that you can file it with or provide to the court if necessary.

  ${resp.name.first} must be served by the hearing deadline for service indicated on your form DV-109, Notice of Court Hearing. If ${resp.name.first} was not timely served or served at all, you can ask the judge to extend the Temporary Restraining Order to a new court date on your request to give you more time to serve your court forms/documents, or to give ${resp.name.first} the lawful amount of time he/she is entitled to respond if the court forms/documents were not timely served (i.e., served by the court's deadline)

  - Complete interview **Part 4.1, Request to Continue Hearing** on your UDIL Member Homepage to complete the necessary court forms. 
  - Ask the judge to sign form DV-116, Order on Request to Continue Court Hearing, at the hearing or give it to the clerk before the hearing to give to the judge to sign.
  - File the signed Order on Request to Continue Hearing (form DV-116) and Request to Continue Hearing (form DV-115) with the clerk 
  - Attach these forms to your other court forms/documents that must be served on ${resp.name.first}
  - After service has been made on ${resp.name.first}, make sure your process server completes a Proof of Personal Service (form DV-200) and gives it to you. **File your Proof of Service with the court.** 
  - Give a cour conformed/endorsed copy of form DV-116 to your local sheriff/police department and to everyone who has a copy of your Temporary Restraining Order (if granted).
  - **Bring copies of your file-stamped Proof of Service to your hearing**

template: service_evasion
subject: |
  What if the other party is avoiding (evading) service?
content: |
  If you are unable to have ${resp.name} personally served with the court forms/documents ordered to be served on him/her, you may request a continuance (read the info box above for more information). If you do not have enough time to request a continuance before your hearing, you may attend your hearing and tell the judge about your situation.
  
  A judge may allow you to serve the court forms/documents ordered for service another way. This is called alternative service. To qualify for alternative service, you must show the judge two things: 
  
  1. You have tried many times (usually 3 or more times) to have someone personally serve ${resp.name.first}. Some examples of ways you can try to have ${resp.name.first} personally served: 
  
    - Serve ${resp.name.first} at his or her home, workplace, or somewhere they go a lot
    - Search online for where ${resp.name.first} may be located
    - Check with ${resp.name.first}'s family or friends
  
  2. You believe ${resp.name.first} is avoiding (evading) service. Be ready to explain why you think ${resp.name.first} is evading service. If you have people who can help you prove this to a judge, you may bring them to your court hearing or have them write a statement that describes what they witnesses. 
  
  Alternative Service may involve other people having acces to your court documents. This means that strangers may be able to see your name, the fact that you want a restraining order against ${resp.name.first}, and possibly your statements regarding the abuse. You may want to talk to an advocate about your safety and privacy concerns before you consider this request. 
  
  Form [DV-205-INFO](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv205info.pdf) addresses these same considerations. We recommend that you take the time to review this court form.

  Examples of Evidence of Abuse
content: |
  Some examples of documents that may help your case include: 
  
  - Screenshots or recordings/transcripts of abusive voicemails or voice messages, text messages, notes, letters, private messages, emails, comments (online or on social media), or other correspondence from ${resp.name.first} (directly or indirectly, such as through friends or family)
  - Medical bills or records of treatment received for injuries (physical or psychological) resulting from Brandon’s abuse (towards yourself, other protected parties, your children, or pets)
  - Photos of injuries or other damage caused by ${resp.name.first}'s abuse
  - Receipts for the cost of repair or replacement of property damaged by ${resp.name.first}’s abuse
  - Police reports (Under Family Code section 6288, victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, and elder abuse are entitled to free copies of all incident reports)

question: |
  Documents to Bring to the Hearing
subquestion: |
  Bring with you to the hearing any documents that help prove the abuse. Ideally, you will have filed these documents with your court forms/documents requesting the restraining order. Bring with you 3 copies of all documents and filed court forms, including the Proof of Service, and be ready to give the other party copies of what you are going to give the judge. 

  ${prog_disclose(evidence_examples)}
  
  It is up to the judge to determine what evidence is permissible in court (i.e., what the judge is allowed to consider). Sometimes the judge will decide he or she cannot look at or consider a piece or pieces of the evidence you bring. 
  
  If you have evidence that you have not filed with the court, and if you want to attend your hearing remotely (by phone or teleconference), contact your local court for information on how to share your evidence with the court and the other side (${resp.name.first} or his/her lawyer).

  I downloaded these forms from other interviews, but they are incomplete. Do I need to bring these forms to the court hearing? What do "Proposed" and "Blank" mean?
content: |
  As a reminder, we did not complete court order documents on your behalf. Official court orders can only be issued by the judge/judicial officer assigned to your case, who will indicate which orders are granted or denied and sign the order forms. 
  
  However, we assisted you by preparing proposed order forms with your case information and the specific orders you requested, and gave you the option to download (or email) these proposed order forms at the end of each applicable interview. You may bring these proposed orders to your hearing, as this helps streamline the process for the court in completing the forms accurately. 
    
  However, out of an abundance of caution, we also recommend bringing blank versions of these forms to your hearing (i.e. court order documents with only your personal, court, and case information prepared), as practices vary from court to court. While some courts prepare your ROAH forms for you, others may prefer for you to bring proposed orders to your hearing.

  What are tentative decisions?
content: |
  In California DVRO hearings, tentative decisions play a significant role in the court process. A tentative decision is a preliminary ruling or judgment made by the judge before the actual hearing takes place. It provides an initial indication of how the judge intends to rule in terms of granting or denying certain requests within the DVRO.

  Here's how tentative decisions typically work:

  - **Issued before the hearing:** Prior to the DVRO hearing, the judge may review the submitted court forms/documents, declarations, and evidence presented by both parties. Based on this review, the judge prepares a tentative decision outlining their preliminary ruling on various requests made in the DVRO.
  - **Availability of tentative decisions:** It's important to note that not all courts issue tentative decisions. Some courts may post them online or provide them in person at the court clerk's office. It's recommended to check with the court or the assigned department to determine if tentative decisions are available.
  - **Purpose of tentative decisions:** The purpose of a tentative decision is to inform the parties about the judge's preliminary position on the case. It allows the parties to have an understanding of the potential outcome and provides an opportunity to prepare arguments or responses accordingly, as well as discuss settlement.
  - **Considered but not final:** Although the judge prepares a tentative decision, it is not final until the actual hearing takes place. The judge may modify their decision based on additional evidence, oral arguments, or clarifications provided during the hearing.
  - **Opportunity to contest:** During the hearing, the parties have the opportunity to present their arguments, challenge the tentative decision, provide additional evidence, or address any issues raised in the tentative decision. This allows for a fair and balanced presentation of the case before the judge reaches a final decision.
  - **Final decision:** Following the hearing and considering all of the information presented, the judge will render a final decision. The final decision supersedes the tentative decision and becomes the official ruling in the DVRO case.

  It's crucial to review any tentative decisions, if available, before the hearing and be prepared to address the judge's preliminary ruling during the actual hearing. It's advisable to consult with an attorney who specializes in family law and domestic violence to understand the tentative decision, and how to proceed with the hearing given what is contained in the tentative decision.

  Remember that each court may have its own procedures and practices regarding tentative decisions, so it's essential to familiarize yourself with the specific rules and guidelines of the court where your DVRO hearing will take place.

  **Witnesses:** You can ask the judge to allow witnesses to speak at your court hearing. If you have a lot of witnesses, you may need to complete additional paperwork before your court hearing. You may call your local court's clerk or visit their website online for more information. Ensure that any witnesses who submitted declarations on your behalf will be present in court (in-person or remotely) for possible cross-examination (${resp.name.first} or his/her attorney reserve the right to ask your witnesses questions).

  #####Practice Giving Your Testimony
  
  Make a list of the orders you want (or don’t want) and practice telling the judge what you want, and why. Because judges typically hear lots of cases each day, you may only have a few minutes to talk to the judge about your case. If you get nervous at the hearing, you may read from your list. You may also write a statement before your hearing and read it to the judge. Be prepared to answer questions that the judge may have for you.

  Can children testify at the hearing? 
content: |
  When it comes to children testifying in court for their parents' DVRO hearing, there are certain standard practices that are typically followed to ensure their well-being and minimize any potential harm. It's important to prioritize the child's safety and emotional well-being throughout the process.

  **Evaluation by a professional:** Before allowing a child to testify, the court may require an evaluation by a child psychologist or other qualified professional. This evaluation helps assess the child's readiness to testify and determines if it is in their best interest, however, note that evaluations are dependent on the availability of the evaluator.

  **Child's preference:** The court may take into consideration the child's preference and willingness to testify. However, the final decision rests with the judge, who will evaluate the child's age, maturity, and ability to provide reliable testimony.

  **Child's emotional support:** The court recognizes the potential emotional impact of testifying, and special measures are often taken to provide emotional support for the child. This can include having a support person present, such as a trusted family member, therapist, or child advocate.

  **Private and child-friendly setting:** Testimony from children is typically conducted in a private and child-friendly setting to ensure their comfort. This may involve using closed-circuit television or a separate room with a video feed to the courtroom, allowing the child to testify without facing the abuser directly. On the day of your hearing, the bailiff may have you and your child(ren) wait outside of the court room for further instruction. 

  **Special questioning:** To minimize the child's distress, the court may use special questioning techniques, such as allowing the child to provide testimony through a child advocate or by having the judge ask questions directly in a gentle and age-appropriate manner.

  **Child's best interest:** Throughout the process, the court's primary consideration is the child's best interest. The judge will carefully weigh the relevance and necessity of the child's testimony against the potential emotional and psychological impact.

  What to Expect After the Court Hearing: Formal Notice
subquestion: |
  When attending your DVRO hearing, it's crucial to be prepared to address the issue of formal notice. At the end of the hearing, the court may inquire about your preference regarding formal notice. This refers to the official written notification of future court dates, filings, or any significant developments in your case.

  You have two options: waiving formal notice or requesting the court to prepare and serve formal notice on your behalf.

  1. **Waiving Formal Notice:** If you choose to waive formal notice, you are essentially stating that you do not require the court to provide you with written notifications of future proceedings. By waiving formal notice, you acknowledge that you are responsible for keeping track of upcoming court dates and staying informed about the progress of your case independently.

  2. **Requesting the Court to Prepare Formal Notice:** On the other hand, if you request the court to prepare and serve formal notice, the court will take responsibility for providing you with written notifications. This ensures that you receive official documentation regarding future hearings, filings, and any crucial updates related to your DVRO case.

  When the court poses this question, be prepared to make a clear and informed decision. Consider factors such as your ability to keep track of court dates and your confidence in staying informed about your case's progress. It's important to understand the implications of waiving formal notice, as it places the responsibility on you to stay updated.

  During the hearing, the court may provide further instructions on how to proceed based on your choice. It's essential to listen carefully to the court's guidance and address any questions or concerns you may have regarding formal notice.

  To decide if the requested orders should be approved or not, the judge will decide if the evidence shows that the person asking for protection (in this case, you) is entitled to a restraining order. The judge will consider the evidence and the safety risks of the adults and children involved in the case. At the end of your hearing, the judge will say what the orders are. The judge may: 
  
  - Give you the orders you asked for.
  - Give you some of the orders you asked for and not others.
  - Not give you any of the orders you asked for.

  What to Expect After the Hearing: If the Restraining Order After Hearing (ROAH) is Granted 
subquestion: |
  After the Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) hearing, if the judge grants an ROAH (Restraining Order After Hearing), there are important next steps for you to take. At U Do It Legal, we understand that preparing the necessary court forms can be overwhelming, so we have provided proposed order forms at the end of each applicable interview. These proposed orders can serve as a helpful starting point when you are preparing the order forms after the hearing.

question: |
  What to Expect After the Hearing: If the Restraining Order After Hearing (ROAH) is Granted 
subquestion: |
  It's important to note that practices may vary from court to court. Some courts will prepare the DVRO/ROAH forms for the parties (you and ${resp.name.first}), while others may provide Minute Orders (written transcripts/summaries of the hearing) and require the parties to prepare the forms themselves. 
  
  To ensure that you have the appropriate forms for your specific court, we have generated both proposed orders (forms we've prepared with the orders you requested) and blank versions of the forms (with just your name and case information prepared). This way, you can choose the version that aligns with the practices of your particular court. 
  
  ${prog_disclose(court_prepares_orders)}
  
  As of 2023, only 6 counties in California do not prepare the Restraining Order After Hearing forms for you if one is granted. Those counties are Alpine, Amador, Lake, Modoc, San Mateo, and Santa Clara. If you are seeking a Domestic Violence Restraining Order in one of those counties, read the information box below.

  Option 1: Your Court Prepares the DVRO/ROAH Forms
content: |
    If the court prepares the order forms for the parties, it means that after the hearing, the court will generate the necessary DVRO/ROAH forms for you based on the judge's decision. You will typically receive these forms from the court clerk or through a designated court process. It's important to carefully review the prepared order forms for accuracy and completeness. If you have any questions or concerns about the prepared forms, it is advisable to seek guidance from the court's clerk, family law facilitator, or self-help center.

  Option 2: Your Court Has You Prepare Proposed DVRO/ROAH Forms
content: |
  If your local court requires you to prepare the DVRO/ROAH forms, make sure to carefully follow any specific instructions provided by the court and accurately prepare the forms with relevant information. The six counties listed above will likely refer you to your local self-help center, whose staff can assist you to prepare proposed orders based on the "Minute Order" received during the hearing. 
    
  The "Minute Order" is a written record of the judge's orders as they were announced, and in some cases, you may receive it at the end of the hearing. However, if it's not immediately available, you have the option to request a copy from the court clerk a few days after the hearing. It is important to refer to the minute order when completing the order forms. If desired, you can also purchase a transcript of the hearing from the court reporter, which provides a verbatim account of all the proceedings (keep in mind that transcripts can be costly, so it's wise to inquire about the estimated expense beforehand).
  
  ${card_start("Note:", color="info")}
  When enforcing the DVRO, the police will only consider the terms written in the official order itself, not the information contained in the transcript or minute order. Therefore, it's crucial that you carefully review the order before leaving the court to ensure that it includes the specific terms you expected.

question: |
  What to Expect After the Hearing: If the Restraining Order is Denied
subquestion: |
  If the judge does not give you a restraining order, talk to an advocate about what you can do to appeal the judge's decision. Unfortunately, we at U Do It Legal currently lack the capacity to service DVRO appeals.
  
  - National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-3224 is a source to inquire about an appeal, or [find your local domestic violence legal help agencies](https://www.cpedv.org/domestic-violence-organizations-california)
  - If ${resp.name.first} continues to abuse you, you can file a new Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order. In the declaration in your new forms, you may tell the judge that ${resp.name.first} has continued to abuse you and describe the most recent abuse.

question: |
  What to Expect After Your Hearing: Next Steps 
subquestion: |
  If you were granted a DVRO/ROAH, your next steps will depend on whether ${resp.name.first} was present at the hearing. 
  
  #####If ${resp.name.first} or his/her Lawyer was at the Hearing:
  
  In a DVRO hearing, if the other party (in this case ${resp.name.first}) or his/her lawyer attended the hearing, they are usually considered to have received notice of the orders issued by the judge at the hearing. In such instances, you will not need to serve ${resp.name.first} with a copy of the DVRO/ROAH. 
  
  However, it is important to note that the exact procedures for providing the orders may vary depending on the specific court and jurisdiction.
  
  #####If ${resp.name.first} or his/her Lawyer was NOT at the Hearing: 
  
  In a DVRO hearing, if the other party (${resp.name.first}) or his/her lawyer did NOT attend the hearing, you must have them served with a copy of the orders. Service may be done personally (using form DV-200 or the local sheriff's/process server's equivalent form) or by mail (using form DV-250). Once service is complete, file the Proof of Service with the court as soon as possible and **keep copies of the file-stamped Proof of Service with copies of your restraining orders at all times.** 
  
  Once you file it with the court, the Proof of Service will show up in California Restraining and Protective Order System (CARPOS) and California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS).
  
  ${card_start("Warning:", color="warning")}
   Note, your ROAH is not enforceable until law enforcement can see a file-stamped Proof of Service in CARPOS/CLETS or confirm that ${resp.name.first} was at the hearing. If ${resp.name.first} or his/her lawyer was not at the hearing and you were issued an ROAH, **keep a copy of your file-stamped Proof of Service with your orders and with you at all times.**

question: |
  Enforcing the Restraining Order After Hearing
subquestion: |
  If the court issues a DVRO and the Restrained Party (in this case ${resp}) violates any provision of the order, it is crucial for you, as the protected party, to contact law enforcement, document the violations, and gather evidence, such as text messages, emails, or witness statements, to support your case. 
  
  You should promptly report any violations to law enforcement (i.e. call the police), providing them with a copy of the order and the evidence of the violations. It may also be helpful for you to consult with a domestic violence advocate to understand the available remedies and the best course of action for enforcing the order. Remember, it is essential for you to prioritize your safety and well-being, and to seek appropriate assistance and support throughout the enforcement process.

  #####Arrest Required if Order is Violated:
  
  If the court issued a DVRO and a police officer has probable cause to believe that the Restrained Person (in this case ${resp.name.first}) had notice of the order (i.e. knew about the restraining order) and has disobeyed the order, the officer must arrest the Restrained Party. (Penal Code sections 836(c)(1), 13701(b).) A violation of the order may be a violation of Penal Code section 166 or 237.6.

  #####If You (the Protected Party) Contact ${resp.name.first} (the Restrained Party) After the Issuance of a DVRO:
  
  Even if the protected person (you) invites or consents to contact with the Restrained Party (${resp.name.first}, the restraining orders remain in effect and must be enforced. The protected person cannot be arrested for inviting or consenting to contact with the Restrained Party. The orders can be changed only by another court order. (Penal Code section 13710(b).)
  
  % if requesting_custody:
  #####Child Custody and Visitation Orders
  
  Child Custody and Visitation orders will be listed on form DV-140, Child Custody and Visitation Order. If the judge makes these orders, look at Items 13 and 14 on the DV-140 to see if the judge granted an exception to any No-Contact or Stay-Away orders for brief and peacful contact with you as needed for court-ordered visitation. Contact by ${resp.name.first} that is *not* brief and peaceful is considered a violation of the order.
