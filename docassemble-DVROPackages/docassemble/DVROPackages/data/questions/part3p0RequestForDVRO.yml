  **DV-100,** Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order
content: |
  Form [DV-100, Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv100.pdf), is a legal document used in California by individuals seeking protection from domestic violence, abuse, or harassment. This form initiates the process for requesting a restraining order by providing the court with necessary information about the petitioner (the person seeking protection, in this case you) and the respondent (the other party), the circumstances on which the request for restraining order is based, and the specific orders requested to ensure the petitioner's safety.

  **DV-110,** Temporary Restraining Order
content: |
  Form [DV-110, Temporary Restraining Order](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv110.pdf), is a legal document issued by a California court that provides short-term protection to individuals claiming to have been the victims of domestic violence, abuse, or harassment. This form is a court order that states the specific restrictions placed on the respondent (the other party) and is typically in effect for two to three weeks, until a court hearing is held to determine whether a longer restraining order is necessary for the petitioner's (person seeking protection) safety.
  
  Please note that we do not complete this form on your behalf. The official court order can only be prepared and issued by the judge/judicial officer assigned to your case. The judge/judicial officer will specify on this form which orders are granted or denied, any additional orders being made, and will sign the order. However, our website will prepare a proposed order that you would like the judge to issue, which you can give to the court clerk along with your DV-100. This proposed order helps streamline the process for the court in completing the form accurately.

  What is a Temporary Restraining Order? 
content: |
  A temporary restraining order, or TRO, is a court order which can provide, depending on what is requested, for one person to temporarily stay away from, or communicate with, the person seeking protection. For example, the temprary order can state that the restrained person cannot come within a certain distance of the protected person's home, vehicle, work, school, and designated household or family members, as well as not telephone (cvcall), text, or email the person seeking protection and designated household or family members. A TRO, if granted, can also order the restrained person to do things such as move out of a shared residence, pay utility bills or child support, and turn over any firearms he/she owns to law enforcement. 

  TROs can be valid for around three weeks (or until the scheduled court hearing) and may be made permanent (up to 5 years) after a hearing. Additionally: 
  
  - Anyone 12 and over can apply for a TRO without parental consent
  - A TRO is issued by a civil court, not a criminal court
  - The respondent (i.e. the person against whom the restraining order is sought) must be served with the TRO before it can be enforced by law enforcement (*we will explain service at the end of this interview*)
  - A TRO is **only valid and enforceable until the date of the hearing**
---
template: court_hearing_explanation
subject: |
	Court Hearing
content: |
  Once you submit your court forms in support of your request for a TRO and DVRO, the court will assess whether a TRO should be granted, and will schedule a hearing on your request for a DVRO. If the judge does not grant a TRO, the judge will nevertheless address your rewquest for a DVRO at the scheduled hearing.

	What is a Domestic Violence Restraining Order?
content: |
  Just like a TRO, a Domestic Violence Restraining Order can help protect you from an abusive partner, a family member, or someone in your household. In California, we often call this order a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (also known as a “Restraining Order After Hearing (ROAH)"). 
  
  The DVRO is a “permanent” restraining order issued by the court against the Other Party **after a hearing**. A DVRO provides the same specific restrictions of a TRO and may be ordered for up to five years. The victim may renew the order when it expires, if necessary.

  ${prog_disclose(tro_explanation)}

  ${prog_disclose(court_hearing_explanation)}
  
  ${prog_disclose(dvro_explanation)}
  
  ${card_start("Summary:", color="info")}

  1) *If granted,* a TRO can protect you and your loved ones before and up until the date of your hearing.
  
  2) Even if a judge does not grant your request for a TRO, you may still be granted a DVRO at your hearing.
  
  3) *If granted,* a DVRO (aka ROAH) can protect you and your loved ones after your hearing, for up to 5 years. You may renew your DVRO before it expires, if necessary. 
  ${card_end()}
  
  ${card_start("Safety Planning:", color="warning")}
  A restraining order is only a part of your overall safety plan. We highly encourage you to speak with a domestic violence advocate for more help with safety planning.

  California mandates that if a party (or his or her children) alleges to be a victim of domestic violence or abuse at the hands of the opposing party, that the victim and his or her children's current address must remain confidential if unknown to the other party. 
  
  The Court requires that you include an address on your forms where you can receive mail regarding the case you are filing, such as a friend or relative's address or P.O. box. **This address does not have to be the place where you live.** Court documents and court files are public record and whatever address is included on your forms will be seen by the other party and anyone else who looks at the Court file.

subject: "I have stepchildren, but I am not their adoptive parent or legal guardian. Why can't I use U Do It Legal to request custody and visitation orders for my stepchildren?"
content: |
  Contrary to what many assume, being a stepparent does not automatically make you a legal guardian or parent under the law. Even if you marry one of the parents of a child, the rights over the child remain with both natural parents after a separation or divorce and only are granted to a stepparent if a court order has been issued granting the stepparent custodial rights. 
  
  If you intend to seek custody and visitation orders for stepchildren that you have not formally adopted or over whom you have not been granted custodial rights, we highly encourage you to seek legal advice from an attorney.

  278.7. Exception; belief of bodily injury or emotional harm; report by person taking or concealing child; confidentiality
  
  - (a) Section 278.5 does not apply to a person with a right to custody of a child who, with a good faith and reasonable belief that the child, if left with the other person, will suffer immediate bodily injury or emotional harm, takes, entices away, keeps, withholds, or conceals that child.
  - (b) Section 278.5 does not apply to a person with a right to custody of a child who has been a victim of domestic violence who, with a good faith and reasonable belief that the child, if left with the other person, will suffer immediate bodily injury or emotional harm, takes, entices away, keeps, withholds, or conceals that child. “Emotional harm” includes having a parent who has committed domestic violence against the parent who is taking, enticing away, keeping, withholding, or concealing the child.
  - (c) The person who takes, entices away, keeps, withholds, or conceals a child shall do all of the following: (1) Within a reasonable time from the taking, enticing away, keeping, withholding, or concealing, make a report to the office of the district attorney of the county where the child resided before the action. The report shall include the name of the person, the current address and telephone number of the child and the person, and the reasons the child was taken, enticed away, kept, withheld, or concealed. (2) Within a reasonable time from the taking, enticing away, keeping, withholding, or concealing, commence a custody proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (Section 1738A, Title 28, United States Code) or the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (Part 3 (commencing with Section 3400) of Division 8 of the Family Code). (3) Inform the district attorney’s office of any change of address or telephone number of the person and the child.
  - (d) For the purposes of this article, a reasonable time within which to make a report to the district attorney’s office is at least 10 days and a reasonable time to commence a custody proceeding is at least 30 days. This section shall not preclude a person from making a report to the district attorney’s office or commencing a custody proceeding earlier than those specified times.
  - (e) The address and telephone number of the person and the child provided pursuant to this section shall remain confidential unless released pursuant to state law or by a court order that contains appropriate safeguards to ensure the safety of the person and the child.

  What does this mean in more simple terms? 
content: |
  This law states that if you have a legal right to custody of a child and you believe, in good faith and with reason, that the child could face immediate physical harm or emotional distress if left with the other parent, you are allowed to take or conceal the child. This also applies to you as an alleged victim of domestic violence if you believe that leaving the child with the Other Party might lead to the child’s immediate harm or distress. Emotional harm can also mean a situation where the Other Party has committed domestic violence against you that adversely affects you emotionally, and you decide to take or hide the child.

  **However, if you take or hide a child under these circumstances, you are required to do the following:**

  - Report to the district attorney’s office in the county where the child lived before you took or concealed them. You should do this within a reasonable time, sharing your name, the child’s current address and phone number, and your reasons for taking or hiding the child.
  - Start a legal process to obtain custody of the child, such as requesting custody and visitation orders through your request for domestic violence restraining orders. You should do this in a court that has jurisdiction and is in line with federal law, such as the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act or the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. This should be done within a reasonable time from when you took or hid the child.
  - Keep the district attorney’s office updated with any changes in your address or phone number, as well as the child’s.

  Under the California Penal Code section 278.7(d), a "reasonable time" to report to the district attorney's office is considered to be at least 10 days. A "reasonable time" to start a custody proceeding is at least 30 days. However, you can choose to do these things sooner.

  Lastly, your address and phone number, and the child’s, that you provide during this process will stay confidential. It can only be disclosed according to state law or by a court order that has necessary safeguards to protect your and the child’s safety.

  Other Protected People
subquestion: |
  If granted, these restraining orders will apply to and protect **only you** unless you request protection for additional people (such as children, roommates, partners, etc.).In other words, you have the opportunity for you to extend protection beyond yourself within this Request for DVRO. This is especially important if you have children or other family members living with you who could also be at risk. 
  
  By including their names and relevant information, you may ask the court to include these loved ones under the umbrella of the restraining order's protection. Doing so helps ensure that the safety measures apply to those close to you, offering them the same legal safeguard against harassment or harm. Remember, the inclusion of additional protected persons can provide a crucial shield for those who might also be vulnerable in your domestic situation.

  Firearms (Guns), Firearms Parts, or Ammunition
subquestion: |
  @ KELLY, Insert Ryan's order video 

  In your Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order case, an important consideration is the firearms restrictions that may be imposed. These restrictions can have a significant impact on the individual who is restrained. If a restraining order is issued, ${resp.name.first} might be required to surrender any guns he or she owns to the police or sell them to a licensed gun dealer. Furthermore, ${resp.name.first} may be prohibited from purchasing any new firearms while the order is in effect. 
  
  These measures are in place to enhance your safety, particularly if the individual from which you are seeking protection has access to guns. It's essential to be aware of these potential implications as you navigate your case.
  
  ${card_start("Tell us about any Firearms, Firearm Parts, or Ammunition:",color="info")}

question: |
  **Requesting Orders:** Property Control 
subquestion: |
  @ KELLY, Insert Ryan's order video 

  Property control is another key factor in Domestic Violence Restraining Order cases. If the court grants this type of order, it gives you temporary control over certain property that you and ${resp.name.first} own or rent. For instance, you may be granted exclusive control over a vehicle, a home, a smartphone, or other shared assets, regardless of who the property is technically registered to. These temporary orders can provide you with necessary stability, ensuring you have a place to live or a means of transportation while your case is ongoing. It's vital to understand this aspect of restraining orders as you work through your case.
  
  If you request a property control order, the court can grant you temporary possession of things that you and ${ resp.name.first } own together (*such as a cell phone, car, computer, etc.*).

question: |
  **Requesting Orders:** Pay Debts (Bills) Owed for Property 
subquestion: |
  @ KELLY, Insert Ryan's order video 

  In Domestic Violence Restraining Order cases, there is a provision known as "Pay Debts (Bills) Owed for Property." This provision allows the court to order ${resp.name.first} to pay certain debts related to property that you both own or rent, such as mortgage payments, utility bills, or other shared financial obligations. However, it's important to note that if you, as the protected party, do not agree to the debt, the judge has the discretion to make special decisions (findings) regarding the payment of those debts. This means that the judge can consider your position and make a determination on the responsibility for payment that is fair and reasonable based on the circumstances of your case. It's crucial to be aware of this aspect of the restraining order process as it can have implications for your financial well-being.
  
  If you want ${resp.name.first} to pay any debts owed for property, you may list them and explain why. The amount can be for the entire bill or only a portion. Some examples include rent, mortgage, car payment, etc.

  More information on Batterer Intervention Programs
content: |
  Batterer intervention programs (BIPs) are programs designed to help individuals who have been abusive or violent in their relationships to change their behavior and learn to interact non-violently with their partners. 

  BIPs typically involve group therapy sessions that focus on teaching participants how to identify and change the attitudes and behaviors that contribute to violence and abuse. These programs may also include education about the dynamics of power and control in relationships, as well as skills training to help participants communicate more effectively and resolve conflicts peacefully.

  Some BIPs may also include individual therapy sessions or other forms of support, such as substance abuse treatment or anger management. The length and frequency of BIP sessions can vary, but they typically involve weekly or biweekly sessions over the course of several months or longer.

  It is important to note that while BIPs can be helpful in some cases, they are not a guarantee that ${resp.name.first} will stop being abusive. It is important for individuals who have experienced domestic violence to also seek out support and safety for themselves, and to have a plan in place in case the abuser does not change their behavior.

  Batterer Intervention Programs (BIPs) are court-ordered programs designed for perpetrators of domestic violence. These programs may consist of educational classes, treatment groups, evaluations, individual counseling, and case management. 
  
  If you request that ${resp.name.first} be ordered to attend a BIP, he or she will have to pay for and attend weekly classes in a 52-week batterer intervention program that teaches accountability, abuse effects, and gender roles to help stop abuse.

  **Requesting Orders:** Property Restraint
subquestion: |
  @ KELLY, Insert Ryan's order video 

  Because you indicated that you and ${ resp.name.first } are currently married (or registered domestic partners), you may request a property restraint order. These orders are intended to protect your property by prohibiting ${resp.name.first}, the Other Party, from disposing, damaging, or transferring it without the court's permission. 
  
  The property can include real estate, vehicles, bank accounts, or other assets. By obtaining a Property Restraint Order, you can ensure that your property remains secure and intact during the legal proceedings. It's important to provide the necessary information and evidence to support your request for such an order to increase the likelihood of its issuance by the court. Remember, these orders are designed to safeguard your property and maintain your financial stability during this challenging time.
  
  Additionally, by requesting a property restraint order, you are asking the judge to order ${ resp.name.first } to notify you of any new or big expenses and to explain them to the court.

  Property Restraint Orders After the Hearing
content: |
  When temporary property restraint orders have been granted in a TRO, the court will carefully consider the circumstances and evidence presented by both parties at a hearing. Note that the extension of property restraint orders may be subject to divorce proceedings, particularly if there are ongoing marital dissolution proceedings (or dissolution proceedings for a registered domestic partnership). In such cases, the court will assess various factors to determine the characterization of each piece of property, including whether it is community, separate, or quasi-community property, as well as its source, value, and other relevant considerations.

  During the hearing, both parties will have the opportunity to present evidence and arguments regarding the property in question. This may involve providing documentation, such as financial records, bank statements, titles, or other relevant evidence, to support their claims about the nature and ownership of the assets. The court will carefully review this evidence and consider any relevant legal principles and guidelines when making a decision.

  What is Spousal Support?
content: |
  Spousal Support (also known as alimony) is a court ordered payment from one spouse to the other to help cover the other's monthly expenses. In California, when it is between married persons, support is called spousal support. It's called domestic partner support between registered domestic partners. A spouse may request and receive “permanent” support orders during a hearing, which are synonymous with long-term support orders. This is because limitations on support may apply and support amounts can be changed if the parties’ financial circumstances change.

  How is Spousal Support Determined?
content: |
  When determining if a spouse spouse should pay support, and in what amount, the court tries to determine the extent to which each spouse's earning capacity (potential to earn income) is sufficient to maintain the marital standard of living (i.e., the lifestyle and spending habits maintained during the marriage). The court considers the following factors:
  
  - The supported spouse's marketable skills and qualifications, as well as the time and expenses of any further education or training needed to enter the job market
  - The length of unemployment that the supported spouse incurred in order to fulfill domestic responsibilities and its effect on his or her employment prospects  
  - The supporting spouse's ability to make payments (based on the paying spouse's earning capacity, earned and unearned income, assets, and standard of living income)
  - The length of the marriage
  - The custodial arrangements of any dependents (such as minor children or adult children with disabilities) 
  - Both parties’ assets and debts
  - Both parties’ age and health

template: cs_factors_explanation

  What factors do the court consider when ordering child support?
content: |  
  In California Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) cases, the amount of child support that can be ordered is determined based on multiple factors. These factors generally include:
    
    - custody and visitation terms (i.e., where do the children live and which parents make parenting decisions), 
    - each parent's income level, 
    - each parent's ability to earn, 
    - each parent's assets and debts, 
    - the number of children involved, and 
    - the child or children's expenses and needs. 
    
    The goal of child support in DVROs is to uphold the child's post-DVRO standard of living and to protect their best interests. 
  
  If the noncustodial parent (i.e., the parent that the children do not live with) has a high income and the ability to earn, the court may order them to pay child support to the lesser-earning custodial parent. The court must determine the best course of action to protect the children's best interests if a noncustodial parent cannot afford child support for multiple children.

  **Option 1:** Ask for Child Support through a Family Law Case (such as through this Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order)
content: |  
  Child support can be ordered during a hearing in a family law case, such as during the hearing on your request for a "permanent" restraining order (DVRO). "Permanent" support orders are synonymous with long-term support orders, as a child support order can be changed by a new order or a stipulation approved by the court. Either parent has the right to ask for a review of the child support order if there is a change in circumstances of either person.
---
template: cs_option2
subject: |
  **Option 2:** Ask for Child Support through a case filed by your Local Child Support Agency (LCSA)
content: |  
  - (a) If you or ${resp.name.first} have been getting public assistance, such as  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the LCSA automatically files a child support case against the noncustodial parent.  The case also includes as a party the custodial parent that is receiving public assistance.
  - (b) Either parent can ask the LCSA to provide child support services, which will then start a child support case.
  - (c) If a child is in foster care, the LCSA may start a child support case against one or both parents.
  - (d) Either parent can ask the LCSA to take over enforcement of a child support order in a family law case (like a divorce, parentage, or DVRO case).

  **Requesting Orders:** Child Custody and Visitation
subquestion: |
  @ KELLY, Insert Ryan's order video 

  Separated parents need to agree between themselves, or have a court decide and order, how and when each parent will spend time with their children (this is physical custody and visitation), and how decisions will be made for their children (this is legal custody). This is the essence of child custody and visitation. The following pages provide an overview of child custody and visitation, and the possible orders that can be requested. At a basic level:

  - **Child Custody** refers to the rights and responsibilities between parents for taking care of their children.
  - **Visitation** (aka parenting time) refers to how and when each parent will spend time with the children.
  
  Sometimes parents can agree on custody and visitation, also referred frequently in the courts as a “parenting plan.” Other times parents need the court to decide on the specific custody and visitation orders because they cannot agree on these orders. 
  
  **Helpful Resources**
  
  For an overview of the child custody and visitation process, please read the [Child Custody Information Sheet](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl314info.pdf).
  
  We also highly encourage you to review the California Court System's [Families Change Website](https://www.familieschange.ca.gov/), which offers a [free course](https://pas.familieschange.ca.gov/en/course/25-parenting-plan) that helps parents, teens, and children deal with a family break up.

Also, ${resp.name.first} will see all the information on your court papers, because you will have to have these papers personally served (delivered) to him or her. 
  
  However, you may ask the court to make some of the information about a child in the case private (confidential from the public) by completing Interview Part 3.3, Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential from the Public. 
  
  If information relating to the minor is made confidential by the court, the public will not have access to this information through public court records. However, note that ${resp.name.first} must be given the information that is necessary to comply with the restraining order and to respond to the restraining order request. Also, the court may give permission to release confidential information in this case to other people like the minor's childcare provider or school, or anyone who needs the information to protect the minor's best interest or to prevent abuse.

   Upload Evidence of Abuse
subquestion: |  
  **Attaching Evidence to Your Declarations**

  Now that you've described incidents of ${resp.name.first}'s abuse in your declarations, it's time to attach the supporting evidence you referred to. As a reminder, you labeled each piece of evidence as Exhibit A, B, C, and so on, within your descriptions. If you did not label your evidence this way, please go back to edit your responses accordingly or ensure that you make the appropriate changes to the court forms generated at the end of this interview. 

  On this page, you can upload the corresponding evidence files to match your descriptions. Make sure each exhibit letter (e.g., "Exhibit A") on the evidence matches the reference in your declarations. This organization will help ensure clarity for the judge who reviews your court forms.
  
  **As a reminder: What can I use as evidence?**
  
  Evidence can include witness testimonial (a verbal account of events by one or more witnesses that you bring with you to court) and documents.
  
  Some examples of evidence include proof of text messages, emails, pictures of injuries or damaged property, copies of a police report, etc. If you have recordings (video or audio), do not upload them on the following pages, but check in with your local Self-Help Center or your court's Family Law Facilitator before your court date to confirm how your county handles these types of evidence. Sometimes judges may require a transcript for a recording. A transcript is a written version of the recording that shows exactly what was said.
  
  For more information on how to document and gather evidence of ${resp.name.first}'s abuse, please review [the Hotline's "Documenting abuse" resource page](https://www.thehotline.org/resources/documenting-abuse/).
