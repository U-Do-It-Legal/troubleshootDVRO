  Your Response paperwork needs to be completed and submitted (filed with the court) before your scheduled hearing date.  
  ${card_end()}
  
  You can find the details of your hearing's date, time, and location in Item 3 on the Notice of Court  Hearing, form DV-109 (see below), which is part of the paperwork the other party had served on (given to) you. 
  
  ${prog_disclose(hearing_date_screenshot_template)}
  
  **Write down your hearing's date, time, and location somewhere important so you don't forget or miss it.** 
  
  It is essential to both file a Response and attend the scheduled hearing if you wish for the court to consider your side of the story. Taking no action may cost you enormously.

question: |
  So you missed your scheduled court date. What now?
subquestion: |
  In a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) proceeding, it's very important to directly contact the court to find out the current status of the case if you have missed a court hearing. Here's what you can do:

  - **Contact the Court Immediately:** As soon as possible, contact the clerk of the court where your case is being heard to find out if a restraining order was issued against you. This is important because if an order was issued, you need to be aware of its terms and comply with them to avoid legal penalties.
  - **Get a Copy of the Order:** If a restraining order has been issued, request a copy of it. The order will contain important details, including the specific restrictions imposed on you and the duration of the order.
  - **Understand the Order:** Read the order carefully to understand all its terms. If there's anything you don't understand, you may ask the court clerk for clarification or seek legal assistance.
  - **Follow the Steps Outlined in the Order:** The order may include instructions for next steps, such as filing a response, attending a future hearing, or other actions you must take.
  - **Legal Compliance:** Strictly adhere to the terms of the restraining order. Violating these terms, even unintentionally, can have serious legal consequences.
  - **Seek Legal Counsel:** It's advisable to consult with a lawyer who can provide you with specific advice tailored to your situation. If hiring a private attorney is not feasible, consider seeking help from legal aid organizations or the court's self-help center.

  By contacting the court directly, you will be able to obtain the most current and accurate information about the status of your case and any orders that may have been issued against you. Remember, timely and informed action is crucial in legal matters, especially in cases involving restraining orders.
  
  Unfortunately, if the court has already issued a restraining order against you, U Do It Legal does not have the capacity to help you appeal the court's decision. 
  
  **However, if the court informs you that the hearing was rescheduled and that you still have time to file a Response and attend the rescheduled hearing date, you may proceed with this interview by pressing 'Continue' below.**

question: |
  **Warning:** Reminder of Your Time-Sensitive Deadlines
subquestion: |
  ${card_start("Need more time to prepare your Response? Request a Continuance:", color="warning")}
  In California DVRO cases, if you need additional time to prepare your Response, you have the right as a Respondent to request a one-time continuance, which is essentially a postponement of your hearing. 
  ${card_end()}
  
  Keep in mind, the court is authorized to grant such postponement requests when there's a demonstrated "good cause" by either party. 
  
  To ask the court to reschedule your hearing, you can access the optional **Part 3.1: Request to Reschedule Hearing** interview at any time on your membership homepage, which is designed to help you complete the Request to Continue Hearing (form DV-115) and a proposed Order on Request to Continue Court Hearing (form DV-116).

question: |
  **Warning:** Reminder of Your Time-Sensitive Deadlines
subquestion: |
  ######Mandatory Firearms Restrictions and Deadlines (pt. 1/3):
fields: 
  - Did the person seeking a restraining order against you claim that you own, use, or possess any firearms, firearm parts, or ammunition? Check Item 6 on the Temporary Restraining Order (form DV-110) you received to see if the court made this finding: has_firearms
    datatype: yesnoradio
    help: |
      These items include Firearms (guns); Firearms parts (receiver, frame, or unfinished receiver or frame as defined in Penal Code section 16531); or Ammunition
  - note: |
      You indicated on a prior page that you were served with a Temporary Restraining Order (form DV-110). Because there was a TRO issued against you, you are prohibited from owning, using, or possessing firearms (guns), firearms parts (receiver, frame, or unfinished receiver or frame as defined in [Penal Code section 16531](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=16531.)), or ammunition until your hearing date, during which the judge will decide whether to make the firearms restrictions permanent.

  **Warning:** Reminder of Your Time-Sensitive Deadlines
subquestion: |
  #####Mandatory Firearms Restrictions and Deadlines (pt. 2/3):

  ${card_start("Your **24 Hour** Deadline", color="warning")}
  Within 24 hours of recieving a TRO (form DV-110) or DVRO/ROAH (form DV-130) issued against you, you **must** sell to or store with a licensed gun dealer, or turn in to law enforcement, any prohibited items you have in your immediate possession or control. 
  ${card_end()}

  ${card_start("Your **48 Hour** Deadline", color="warning")}
  Within 48 hours of receiving a TRO (form DV-110) or DVRO/ROAH (form DV-130) issued against you, you **must** file a receipt with the court that proves all prohibited items have been turned in, sold, or stored. If law enforcement serves you with a restraining order, you must give a copy of the receipt to that law enforcement agency.
  ${card_end()}

  ${card_start("Hearing on Firearms Restrictions:", color="warning")}
   If the other party has alleged that you possess firearms, the court may have scheduled a hearing for you to provide evidence of the prohibited items' surrender, safekeeping, or sale. To find the date, time, and location of this compliance hearing, please check Item 3 on form DV-840/FL-840 (the Notice of Compliance Hearing for Firearms and Ammunition) or Item 7 on form DV-110 (the Temporary Restraining Order; see the screenshot below).
  [FILE dv110_item7_screenshot, 100%]
  ${card_end()}

  *For more information about these firearms restrictions, see Item 5 on page 2 of the Temporary Restraining Order (form DV-110) issued against you and review the court's helpful information sheet ([form DV-800-INFO](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/dv800info.pdf)) on turning-in, selling, or storing prohibited items.*

  #####TRO Review Introduction (pt. 1/2):
  
  Thank you for sharing the basic details of your case.
  
  The next section aims to guide you through the TRO (form DV-110) that is currently in effect against you, ensuring you understand how to comply with the temporary restraining orders.

  **As a Reminder:** What is a Temporary Restraining Order?
content: |  
  A Temporary Restraining Order is an order issued by the court to offer immediate protection to the protected party (in this case ${pet}) by placing restrictions on the respondent's actions (in this case, your actions). 
  
  The TRO is valid and enforceable temporarily, from the moment you were served to the end of the scheduled court hearing, at which point the judicial officer will either remove the temporary restraining orders or grant permanent restraining orders under a DVRO. 
  
  Because you have been served with a TRO, it's crucial to understand its terms and adhere to them strictly. Violating any of these orders can have serious legal consequences (see below).

template: tro_noncompliance_consequences
subject: |
  **As a reminder:** Consequences of Not Abiding by the TRO
content: |  
  Non-compliance with a TRO (i.e. not following the instructions and restrictions on the TRO) can lead to:

  - Criminal charges, which could result in your arrest and jail time.
  - Fines and other penalties.
  - Weakening of your position in any related court proceedings (cases).
  - Additional restraining orders or extensions of the existing order.

  It is in your best interest to read, understand, and adhere to all the terms outlined in the TRO, which we will help you do on the following pages.

  Form DV-110 (Temporary Restraining Order): Items 5, 6, and 7 Firearms Restrictions and Hearing
subquestion: |
  #####**Item 5:** No Firearms (Guns), Firearm Parts, or Ammunition (pt. 2/3):

  More specifically, this section explains that you are prohibited from owning, possessing, or controlling firearms, firearm parts, or ammunition. The list of prohibited items includes:

  - Firearms: This includes handguns, rifles, shotguns, and assault weapons.
  - Firearm parts: These include receivers, frames, unfinished receivers, or frames, often referred to as “ghost guns.”
  - Ammunition: This includes bullets, shells, cartridges, and clips.

  If you possess any of the items listed, you must either turn them in to law enforcement, sell them to a licensed gun dealer, or store them with a licensed gun dealer. It's essential to do this immediately if asked by law enforcement. Otherwise, it must be done within 24 hours of being served the order. 
  
  Before turning them in, ensure prohibited items have been safely unloaded. Transport them safely. Bring a copy of the restraining order with you. After surrendering your firearms, there are procedures for reclaiming them once the restraining order expires, so it's a good idea to ask about these details.
  
  **If you do not surrender these items within 24 hours**, the court will notify law enforcement, a prosecuting atrtorney, or another agency and **you could be arrested for violating the restraining order or charged with a state or federal crime.** 
  
  You are not allowed to give these prohibited items to family or friends.

  What if the court claims that I am in possession of prohibited firearms that I don't actually have?
content: |
  If you are falsely accused by the protected party under a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) of possessing prohibited firearms that you don't actually have, you have several courses of action:
  
  - **Legal Representation:** In this situation, it is highly advisable for you to consult with or hire an attorney who can provide guidance specific to your situation. An attorney can help refute the allegations, represent you in court, and ensure your rights are protected.
  - **Gather Evidence:** You can compile any evidence that proves you do not own or have possession of the firearms in question. This evidence can include receipts of sale, affidavits from credible witnesses, and other relevant documents.
  - **Present Evidence at the Hearing:** If a TRO is issued based on false allegations, remember that you still have the right to present evidence at the hearing to demonstrate that you do not possess the alleged firearms. If Item 7 on the TRO (form DV-110) is completed, the court scheduled a hearing to specifically review your compliance with the firearms restrictions, during which you can present your evidence. If no information is written in Item 7 on the TRO issued against you, you will have the opportunity to tell your side of the story during the hearing scheduled in Item 4. 
  - **File a Declaration:** Instead of completing and filing form DV-800/JV-270, Receipt for Firearms, Firearm Parts, and Ammunition, you can file a sworn declaration (a written statement) with the court stating you do not own or possess the firearms you are accused of having. **This declaration must be truthful, as filing a false statement equates to committing perjury (lying under oath), which is a felony that can result in criminal charges, arrest, and jail time.**

  #####**Item 7:** Court Hearing to Review Firearms (Guns), Firearms Parts, and Ammunition Compliance:

  This section lists the date, time, and location of the Hearing to Review Firearms, Firearm Parts, and Ammunition Compliance. This hearing is separate from the hearing scheduled in Item 4, and it is for the purposes of determining if you have surrendered any and all probited items in your posession.
  
  To prove to the judge that you've followed the orders, you'll need to bring a copy of form DV-800/JV-270, which should be completed and signed by the dealer or officer who accepted your items (again, we help you prepare this court form in the Part 2.3 Interview on your membership homepage). This receipt needs to be filed with the court within 48 hours of you being given the Temporary Restraining Order (form DV-110). 

  If you fail to file the receipt or attend the hearing and the court notifies another agency about your non-compliance, you may be arrested and need to provide additional proof of compliance to the specified agencies.

  If you have not yet been approached by law enforcement, here is some helpful information about the Move-Out Order:

  - **Immediate Action Required:** This order mandates that you leave and stay away from the residence you might be sharing with ${pet} or any other protected individuals. This must be done promptly.
  - **Collecting Personal Belongings:** You might be allowed a short, one-time visit to collect necessary personal items, but this requires accompaniment by a law enforcement officer to ensure the visit remains peaceful. Before doing so, check the specific terms of your order and consult with local law enforcement.
  - **No Return Until Further Notice:** Until the court states otherwise or the TRO is lifted, you cannot return to or live at the residence. Even if you own the property or your name is on the lease, this order temporarily overrides those rights to ensure the safety of the protected individuals.
  - **Possible Duration:** The length of the move-out order can vary. It might last until the court hearing or could be extended if a permanent restraining order (DVRO) is put in place. Always refer to your order's specifics.

  If a property control order, along with stay-away and no-contact orders, are all in effect under a TRO, it can be challenging for you, the restrained party, to transfer or return property to ${pet.name.first}, the protected party, without violating the order. However, there are common strategies to ensure compliance:

  - **Third-Party Exchange:** A neutral third party, such as a family member or friend mutually agreed upon by both parties, can facilitate the exchange of property. You give the property to the third party, who then delivers it to ${pet.name.first}.
  - **Law Enforcement Assistance:** In some jurisdictions, local law enforcement agencies offer civil standby assistance, where an officer supervises the brief interaction ensuring no breach of the stay-away and no-contact orders occurs. You can contact your local police department or sheriff's office to inquire about this service.
  - **Public Location:** Some TROs allow for brief and peaceful contact for specific purposes, like exchanging property. If the TRO has such a provision it might be listed under Item 13 "Other Orders" or subsection b. "Exception to 11a" under Item 11 "Stay-Away Order". If this is the case on the form DV-110 you received, the exchange can occur in a public place, reducing the risk of confrontation.
  - **Written Communication:** If allowed by the TRO, you can communicate in writing (email, text, or through a lawyer) specifying the intent to return property and coordinating the logistics of the transfer in a way that respects the no-contact and stay-away orders. Exceptions to the No-Contact order may be found under Item 13 "Other Orders" or subsection b.(3) under Item 10 "No-Contact Order".
  - **Legal Representation:** If both parties have attorneys, the exchange of property can be facilitated through them. In this situation, you would give the property to your attorney, who would then coordinate with ${pet.name.first}'s attorney for the transfer.
  - **Storage Option:** You can place the items in a storage facility and give ${pet.name.first} the access details, ensuring no direct contact.

  If you pursue any of the options above, it's crucial for you to document the transfer process, ensuring there's evidence of efforts made to respect the TRO's conditions. Before taking any action, you should review the TRO carefully to ensure full compliance.

  Form DV-110 (Temporary Restraining Order): Item 19, Property Restraint
subquestion: |
  [@ KELLY, Insert Ryan's Video Clip]
  #####**Item 19:** Property Restraint:
  
  The Property Restraint Order dictates how you and ${pet} can handle shared or jointly-owned property during the duration of the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO).

  - **Protecting Assets:** Essentially, this order is issued to prevent either party from making significant changes to or disposing of shared property. This includes selling, borrowing against, hiding, or damaging any property, whether it's real estate, personal belongings, or other valuable assets.
  - **Regular Expenses:** However, this order doesn't prevent you or ${pet} from using shared property or funds for typical daily expenses or costs related to running a business. It's meant to protect assets, not hinder everyday life.
  - **Violation Consequences:** It's crucial to be aware that not following this order can result in substantial legal consequences, which can include the court awarding jointly owned property to ${pet.name.first}. If you're uncertain about whether a particular action might violate the Property Restraint Order, it's wise to seek clarification from the court or your local Family Law Facilitator before proceeding.

  Remember, this order is temporary and aims to maintain the status quo of your assets until a more permanent decision can be made by the court at the scheduled hearing.

  #####**Item 20:** Debt Payment Order:

  - **Your Obligations:** The court has ordered you to pay, or continue paying, each debt written under Item 20 while the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) is in effect. Ensure you pay the specified amount, to the designated recipient, and by the outlined due dates.
  - **Managing Shared Debts:** These debts can include responsibilities like mortgages, credit card bills, loans, or other shared financial commitments.
  - **Special Findings by the Judge:** Please be aware that the judge can make specific decisions about these debts. If it's determined that you took on a debt in ${pet.name.first}'s name without his or her knowledge or consent, the judge has the authority to decide that you are solely responsible for paying it off.
  
  The main goal of this section is to provide clear guidelines on managing shared debts fairly and transparently during the TRO's duration, helping you avoid any financial misunderstandings or surprises.

  #####**Item 21:** Child Support Orders:
  
  **What is Child Support?** Child support is the amount of money that a court orders a parent or both parents to pay every month to help pay for the support of a child (or children) and the child’s living expenses.
  
  Because you indicated that ${pet.name.first} requested child support orders on the Request for DVRO (form DV-100), it's essential for you to complete the **Part 2.1: Financial Information for Support** interview. You can access this interview on your membership homepage. The Part 2.1 interview is designed to assist you in preparing the court's Income and Expense Declaration (form FL-150). The Income and Expense Declaration offers the court valuable insights into your financial situation, which will be used by the judge to determine any potential child support orders during the hearing, if deemed necessary.

  What factors do the court consider when ordering child support?
content: |  
  In California Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) cases, the amount of child support that can be ordered is determined based on multiple factors. These factors generally include:
    
    - custody and visitation terms (i.e., where do the children live and which parents make parenting decisions), 
    - each parent's income level, 
    - each parent's ability to earn, 
    - each parent's assets and debts, 
    - the number of children involved, and 
    - the child or children's expenses and needs. 
    
    The goal of child support in DVROs is to uphold the child's post-DVRO standard of living and to protect their best interests. 
  
  If the noncustodial parent (i.e., the parent that the children do not live with) has a high income and the ability to earn, the court may order them to pay child support to the lesser-earning custodial parent. The court must determine the best course of action to protect the children's best interests if a noncustodial parent cannot afford child support for multiple children.

  **Option 1:** Ask for Child Support through a Family Law Case (such as through this Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order)
content: |  
  Child support can be ordered during a hearing on a request for a "permanent" restraining order (DVRO). "Permanent" support orders are synonymous with long-term support orders, as a child support order can be changed by a new order or a stipulation approved by the court. Either parent has the right to ask for a review of the child support order if there is a change in circumstances of either person.
---
template: cs_option2
subject: |
  **Option 2:** Ask for Child Support through a case filed by your Local Child Support Agency (LCSA)
content: |  
  - (a) If you or ${pet.name.first} have been getting public assistance, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the LCSA automatically files a child support case against the noncustodial parent.  The case also includes as a party the custodial parent that is receiving public assistance.
  - (b) Either parent can ask the LCSA to provide child support services, which will then start a child support case.
  - (c) If a child is in foster care, the LCSA may start a child support case against one or both parents.
  - (d) Either parent can ask the LCSA to take over enforcement of a child support order in a family law case (like a divorce, parentage, or DVRO case).

  #####Spousal/Partner Support Orders:
  
   **What is Spousal Support?** Spousal Support (also known as alimony) is a court ordered payment from one spouse to the other to help cover the other's monthly expenses. In California, when it is between married persons, support is called spousal support. It's called domestic partner support between registered domestic partners. A spouse may request and receive “permanent” support orders during a hearing, which are synonymous with long-term support orders. This is because limitations on support may apply and support amounts can be changed if the parties’ financial circumstances change.

  ${prog_disclose(ss_calculator)}
  
  ${card_start("To put it simply:", color="info")}
  Judges order support based on needs and ability to pay. The judge decides the amount by looking at: 1) The needs of spouse with less money, and 2) The spouse with more money's ability to pay. They’ll look at how much one spouse needs to meet their expenses and whether the other spouse makes enough to meet that need.

  How is Spousal Support Determined?
content: |
  When determining if a spouse spouse should pay support, and in what amount, the court tries to determine the extent to which each spouse's earning capacity (potential to earn income) is sufficient to maintain the marital standard of living (i.e., the lifestyle and spending habits maintained during the marriage). The court considers the following factors:
  
  - The supported spouse's marketable skills and qualifications, as well as the time and expenses of any further education or training needed to enter the job market
  - The length of unemployment that the supported spouse incurred in order to fulfill domestic responsibilities and its effect on his or her employment prospects  
  - The supporting spouse's ability to make payments (based on the paying spouse's earning capacity, earned and unearned income, assets, and standard of living income)
  - The length of the marriage
  - The custodial arrangements of any dependents (such as minor children or adult children with disabilities) 
  - Both parties’ assets and debts
  - Both parties’ age and health

  #####Item 21: Lawyer's Fees and Costs: 
  
  Based on your prior responses, it appears that ${pet} requested an order for Lawyer's Fees and Costs as part of the Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order (form DV-100).

  Now, let's consider two possible scenarios:

  1. Should ${pet.name.first} prevail (win) in court, you may be ordered to cover their Lawyer's Fees and Costs. In other words, if the judge rules in favor of ${pet.name.first}, you may be responsible for paying their legal fees and associated expenses.
  2. Conversely, if you believe the allegations against you are baseless or unjustified, and if you successfully defend yourself against ${pet.name.first}'s claims, the court may order ${pet.name.first} to reimburse you for any Lawyer's Fees and Costs you incurred due to this case. This means that if you prevail and can demonstrate that the DVRO request was unwarranted, the court could require ${pet.name.first} to cover your legal expenses, ensuring that you're not unfairly burdened by the costs of your defense.
  
  Because you indicated that ${pet.name.first} requested an order that you pay their Lawyer's Fees and Costs on the the Request for DVRO (form DV-100), it's essential for you to complete the **Part 2.1: Financial Information for Support** interview. You can access this interview on your membership homepage. The Part 2.1 interview is designed to assist you in preparing the court's Income and Expense Declaration (form FL-150).

To do so, ${pet.name.first} will need to provide evidence of these expenses during your scheduled hearing.

  Note, there is no specific limit on the amount of expenses for which ${pet.name.first} can seek reimbursement. The court will ultimately decide whether to grant full or partial reimbursement for the expenses incurred by ${pet.name.first}, or it may direct you to pay the service provider directly.

  More information on Batterer Intervention Programs
content: |
  Batterer intervention programs (BIPs) are programs designed to help individuals who have been abusive or violent in their relationships to change their behavior and learn to interact non-violently with their partners. 

  BIPs typically involve group therapy sessions that focus on teaching participants how to identify and change the attitudes and behaviors that contribute to violence and abuse. These programs may also include education about the dynamics of power and control in relationships, as well as skills training to help participants communicate more effectively and resolve conflicts peacefully.

  Some BIPs may also include individual therapy sessions or other forms of support, such as substance abuse treatment or anger management. The length and frequency of BIP sessions can vary, but they typically involve weekly or biweekly sessions over the course of several months or longer.

  Jurisdictional Authority: Why does the court handling the case have the right to do so?
content: |
  **Understanding Jurisdictional Authority**

  Jurisdictional authority refers to a court's legal power to hear and decide on a case. It's like a court's permission to handle a case, and it's usually based on where the people involved live, work, or where the events in question happened. For example, a court in Los Angeles might not have the jurisdictional authority to decide on a restraining order case if everyone involved lives in San Francisco. In the context of a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) case in California, the court where the case is filed should have a connection to the parties or the incidents involved. If you think the court where the Petitioner (${pet.name.first}) filed the case doesn't have this connection or the right to hear the case, you might want to challenge the court's jurisdictional authority. This is a complex step, so understanding the rules and, if possible, getting legal advice could be beneficial.

  What can I do if I believe another court should be trying this case instead?
content: |
  **Contesting Jurisdictional Authority:**

  If you believe that the court where the Petitioner (${pet.name.first}) filed the case does not have the jurisdictional authority to hear the case, you have the right to contest the jurisdiction. However, it's important to note that U Do It Legal lacks the capacity to assist in filing motions challenging jurisdictional authority. Contesting jurisdiction is a more advanced legal step that might require a sound understanding of California jurisdiction laws and potentially the assistance of an experienced attorney.

  Here's a breakdown of the steps you may need to complete to contest the court's jurisdictional authority in your case:

  - **Research Jurisdiction Rules:** Understand the jurisdiction rules applicable in California DVRO proceedings. Jurisdiction typically relates to the geographical area where the parties live, work, or where the alleged domestic violence occurred.
  - **Seek Legal Advice:** It's advisable to consult with a legal professional to understand the implications and the procedure of contesting jurisdiction. This step might help clarify the likelihood of success in contesting jurisdiction and the potential benefits.
  - **File a Motion:** If after consulting you still wish to proceed, you'll need to file a motion to contest jurisdiction. This motion should be well-argued, stating clearly why you believe the court lacks jurisdiction over your case.
  - **Attend the Hearing:** A hearing will be scheduled where you'll present your arguments. It's crucial to be well-prepared and to have all necessary documentation to support your claim.
  - **Abide by the Court’s Decision:** After hearing your motion, the court will decide whether or not it has jurisdiction. If the court agrees with you, the case may be transferred to a different court or dismissed. If the court disagrees, the case will proceed in the original court.

  Remember, contesting jurisdiction can be a complex legal endeavor. It's crucial to have a clear understanding of the laws and procedures involved, and where possible, to seek professional legal advice to navigate through this process.

   @ RYAN:
   
   I understand your concern about sentences ending in prepositions and that you'll probably have an aneurysm reading the descriptions on these next few pages. However, I want to stress that this phrasing aligns with the text written on the CA DVRO judicial council forms. For the sake of our users' understanding, I think we need to prioritize consistency and clarity over grammatical formality in this context.
subquestion: |
  #####**Read These Instructions Before Proceeding**

  After reviewing ${pet.name.first}'s allegations against you and ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the case's basic information, your next step is to review each specific order requested on form DV-100. For each order that ${pet.name.first} requested, you will have the opportunity to either:
  
  1. Agree to the order, or 
  2. Disagree to the order and describe a different order that you would agree to.
  
  **What happens if I agree with an order?**
  
  For each order that you and ${pet.name.first} both agree to, the judge will typically grant the order unless he or she determines that doing so would be against the best interest of all parties.   
  
  **What happens if I disagree with an order?**
  
  For each requested order that you disagree with, you are able to present your perspective to the court. Here, you can explain your side of the story and offer counter-arguments. 
  
  ${card_start("Warning:", color="warning")}
  If you were arrested recently, are on probation, or have a criminal case open, you should talk to your criminal lawyer before you put anything in writing. If you don't have a lawyer, you can go to a Self-Help Center to learn more about your options.

  Response to Request for DVRO: Have Your Evidence Available

  #####**Read These Instructions Before Proceeding**
  
  Refering To and Attaching Evidence:
  
  As mentioned on the previous page, for each order that you disagree with, you will have the opportunity to explain why you disagree and describe a different order that you would agree to. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to upload evidence to support your explanations, such as screenshots, photos, bills, receipts, or other documents to support your side of the story. Each piece of evidence you attach to your DV-120 form is called an "Exhibit," and each exhibit will have a cover sheet with its exhibit number.
  
  To keep things organized for the judge who will review your court forms, **you must refer to each piece of evidence as Exhibit 1, 2, 3, and so on, in your descriptions.** You can refer to the same Exhibit in multiple explanations if need be. Ensure that you either upload this evidence in the next section of this interview or attach paper copies to the back of your completed form DV-120. 
  
  If you upload your evidence, review the forms we generate for you at the end of this interview to ensure that the exhibit number (e.g. "Exhibit 1") you used to refer to each piece of evidence corresponds with how your exhibit pages are organized and attached to the Response to Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order (form DV-120).

  What is an Order to Move-Out
content: |
  [@ KELLY, insert Ryan's TRO Denied Order clip]
  
  #####**Item 13:** Order to Move Out:
  
  If a Move-Out order is granted, you will likely be approached by a law enforcement officer and accompanied home to move out of the residence you share with ${pet.name.first}. Here is some helpful information about the Move-Out Order:

  - **Immediate Action Required:** If granted, this order mandates that you leave and stay away from the residence you might be sharing with ${pet} or any other protected individuals. This must be done promptly.
  - **Collecting Personal Belongings:** You might be allowed a short, one-time visit to collect necessary personal items, but this requires accompaniment by a law enforcement officer to ensure the visit remains peaceful. Before doing so, check the specific terms of your order and consult with local law enforcement.
  - **No Return Until Further Notice:** Until the court states otherwise or the DVRO is lifted, you cannot return to or live at the residence. Even if you own the property or your name is on the lease, this order overrides those rights to ensure the safety of the protected individuals.
  - **Possible Duration:** The length of a move-out order can vary. If granted, Domestic Violence Restraining Orders typically last up to 5 years and can be extended if the protected party files a request to renew the order. Always refer to your order's specifics.

  If you're unsure about any aspect of this order, consider seeking legal advice or clarifications from the appropriate law enforcement authorities.

  #####**Item 14:** Other Orders:
  
  If the court issues Other Orders, here's what you need to know:

  - **Custom Instructions:** Unlike the other, more 'standard' items on the Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order (form DV-100), "Other Orders" might contain specific instructions or provisions tailored to your unique situation. If granted, these are additional rules the court feels are necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of ${pet} or other protected individuals.
  - **Varied Nature:** The additional orders under this section can range widely. They might include things like attending counseling, avoiding certain places, or any other specific actions or restrictions. Ensure you thoroughly understand the orders that ${pet.name.first} requested in this section. 
  - **Importance:** Even though these orders might seem different from the more 'standard' ones, they are just as legally binding. Not following these can lead to severe legal consequences.
  - **Seek Clarification:** If there's any part of this section you don't understand or are unsure about, it's crucial to get clarity. This might mean consulting with your local court's Family Law Facilitator or reaching out to the court.

  - **Legal Context:** In California, it's typically illegal to record confidential communication, including a private conversation or call, without the consent of all parties to the conversation. This means that if you're participating in a conversation, you typically need the permission of all the other participants to legally record the conversation.

  What are Property Restraint Orders?
content: |
  [@ KELLY, insert Ryan's TRO Denied Order clip]
  
  #####**Item 20:** Property Restraint Order:
    
  If granted, a Property Restraint Order dictates how you and ${pet} can handle shared or jointly-owned property:

  - **Protecting Assets:** Essentially, this order is issued to prevent either party from making significant changes to or disposing of shared property. This includes selling, borrowing against, hiding, or damaging any property, whether it's real estate, personal belongings, or other valuable assets.
  - **Regular Expenses:** However, this order doesn't prevent you or ${pet} from using shared property or funds for typical daily expenses or costs related to running a business. It's meant to protect assets, not hinder everyday life.
  - **Violation Consequences:** It's crucial to understand that if this order is issued, not following it can result in substantial legal consequences, which can include the court awarding jointly owned property to ${pet.name.first}. If you're uncertain about whether a particular action might violate the Property Restraint Order, it's wise to seek clarification from the court or your local Family Law Facilitator before proceeding.

  Response to Request for DVRO: Extend ${pet.name.first}'s Deadline to Give You Notice

  Look at Item 21 on form DV-100. 

  If ${pet.name.first} completed this section, that means that she requested the court to allow her more time to provide you, the respondent, with the official notice of the restraining order proceedings. It’s a formal request to the court for a little extra time beyond the standard legal timeframe typically allowed for serving you notice of their request for the restraining order.
  
  This extension could be for a variety of reasons, such as difficulty in locating you to serve the papers, or the need for additional time to prepare and ensure the notice is delivered correctly. ${pet.name.first}'s reason should be stated in this section.

  [@ KELLY, insert Ryan's TRO Denied Order clip]
  
  #####**Item 22:** Pay Debts (Bills) Owed for Property
    
  If ${pet.name.first} completed this section, it means they're asking the court to order you to pay debts that are due for any property you both own or use. This could include things like mortgage payments, utility bills, or car loan payments for property that's being shared or used by one party. Essentially, they're requesting that the court make it clear who is responsible for these payments while the restraining order is in effect.
  
  - **Your Obligations:** If this order is issued, the court will order you to pay, or continue paying, each debt/bill specified while the DVRO is in effect. You'll need to pay the specified amount, to the designated recipient, and by the outlined due dates.
  - **Managing Shared Debts:** These debts can include responsibilities like mortgages, credit card bills, loans, or other shared financial commitments.
  - **Special Findings by the Judge:** Please be aware that the judge can make specific decisions about these debts. If it's determined that you took on a debt in ${pet.name.first}'s name without his or her knowledge or consent, the judge has the authority to decide that you are solely responsible for paying it off. If any of the boxes under b(1) or b(2) are checked, ${pet.name.first} is claiming that they did not agree to one or more debts listed under Item 24, and they are requesting that the court hold you responsible for repaying each applicable debt.

The idea is to have you, the respondent, take financial responsibility for the consequences of the actions that led to this restraining order request.
  
  Note, there is no specific limit on the amount of expenses for which ${pet.name.first} can seek reimbursement. The court will ultimately decide whether to grant full or partial reimbursement for the expenses incurred by ${pet.name.first}, or it may direct you to pay the service provider directly.

    help: |
      **What is guideline child support?** Courts generally use computer software approved by the California Judicial Council to calculate child support pursuant to a “guideline” formula that applies to the specific county in which the case has been filed. However, in certain cases a court might elect to deviate from ordering guideline child support based on the facts and circumstances of the case, and might elect to determine child support separate from using the approved software. The calculation and determination of child support or estimated child support are services that U Do It Legal does not provide. If you wish to obtain an assessment regarding the amount of child support that can potentially be ordered in your case, we recommend that you see if the court in which your case is filed has a Family Law Facilitator or Self-Help Center that might be able to provide you an estimate of the child support that could be ordered in your case. There are also support estimation calculators available online, although we cannot attest to their accuracy.

  What is Spousal Support?
content: |
  #####Spousal/Partner Support Orders:
  
   **What is Spousal Support?** Spousal Support (also known as alimony) is a court ordered payment from one spouse to the other to help cover the other's monthly expenses. In California, when it is between married persons, support is called spousal support. It's called domestic partner support between registered domestic partners. A spouse may request and receive “permanent” support orders during a hearing, which are synonymous with long-term support orders. This is because limitations on support may apply and support amounts can be changed if the parties’ financial circumstances change.
   
  Because you indicated that ${pet.name.first} requested spousal support orders on the Request for DVRO (form DV-100), it's essential for you to complete the **Part 2.1: Financial Information for Support** interview. You can access this interview on your membership homepage. The Part 2.1 interview is designed to assist you in preparing the court's Income and Expense Declaration (form FL-150).

  ${card_start("To put it simply:", color="info")}
  Judges order support based on needs and ability to pay. The judge decides the amount by looking at: 1) The needs of spouse with less money, and 2) The spouse with more money's ability to pay. They’ll look at how much one spouse needs to meet their expenses and whether the other spouse makes enough to meet that need.

  If ${pet} requested an order for Lawyer's Fees and Costs as part of the Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order (form DV-100), consider two possible scenarios:

  1. Should ${pet.name.first} prevail (win) in court, you may be ordered to cover their Lawyer's Fees and Costs. In other words, if the judge rules in favor of ${pet.name.first}, you may be responsible for paying their legal fees and associated expenses.
  2. Conversely, if you believe the allegations against you are baseless or unjustified, and if you successfully defend yourself against ${pet.name.first}'s claims, the court may order ${pet.name.first} to reimburse you for any Lawyer's Fees and Costs you incurred due to this case. This means that if you prevail and can demonstrate that the DVRO request was unwarranted, the court could require ${pet.name.first} to cover your legal expenses, ensuring that you're not unfairly burdened by the costs of your defense.

  **Refering To/Attaching Evidence**

  Using the space below, explain why you do not agree to any of the orders ${pet} requested. This declaration is your opportunity to present additional testimony, reasoning, evidence, or argument in support of the orders you're opposing (or in support of alternative orders that you would agree with).
  
  Afterwards, you will have the opportunity to upload files of the evidence to which you referred in your declaration, such as screenshots, photos, bills, or receipts. 
  
  To keep things organized for the judge who will review your court forms, **you must refer to each piece of evidence as Exhibit 1, 2, 3, and so on.** Then, ensure that you upload the corresponding evidence on the following pages. 
  
  Review the forms we generate for you at the end of this interview to ensure that the exhibit number (e.g. "Exhibit 1") you used to refer to each piece of evidence corresponds with how your exhibit pages are organized and attached to your Response to Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order form (form DV-120).
