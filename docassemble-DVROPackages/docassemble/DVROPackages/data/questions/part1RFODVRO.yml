  **FL-300**, Request For Order 
content: |
  [Form FL-300](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl300.pdf) is the form that this interview will help you prepare to request that the court make changes to your existing restraining order. If there's something about the order that isn't working for you, or if the situation has changed and you feel the order is no longer necessary, you use this form to tell the court exactly what you want to change and why. This could be anything from modifying visitation to canceling the restraining order entirely. You'll need to provide details about whatâ€™s changed in your situation that makes you believe a modification or termination is needed. It's also the form you'd use to request new orders, like child custody, if that hasnâ€™t been settled yet."

  Remember, any changes to the order need to be approved by a judge, so filling out this form is just the first step. After you submit it, there will be a court hearing where you can explain your reasons to the judge.
