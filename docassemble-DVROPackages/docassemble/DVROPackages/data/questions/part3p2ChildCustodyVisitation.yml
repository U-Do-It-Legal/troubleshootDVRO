  **DV-105,** Request for Child Custody and Visitation Orders
content: |
  Form DV-105, Request for Child Custody and Visitation Orders, is the California court form required to request child custody and visitation orders in cases of domestic violence when a restraining order is being requested. This form allows the parent to propose a parenting plan for the court to order that states how custody and visitation of children will be shared is a restraining order is issued.

  **DV-108,** Request for Child Abduction Prevention Orders (*optionally request child abduction prevention orders**)
content: |
  Form DV-108, Request for Child Abduction Prevention Orders, is the court form required to request specific orders to prevent a child from being abducted by a parent or other family member. This enables the requesting party to provide information demonstrating that a credible and real risk exists that the child may be abducted, and request that specific protective measures be ordered to prevent the specified child from being abducted and remain safe. 
---
template: dv_140_explanation
subject: |
  **DV-140,** Child Custody and Visitation Order
content: |
  Form DV-140 is a court order that states the orders to be followed regarding how the child custody and visitation will be shared between parents in cases involving domestic violence and a request for a restraining order. The orders contained in this form are those either made by the court following a hearing, or mutually agreed by the parents either prior to or at the court hearing on the request for child custody and visitation orders. 

  In cases where the parents have not mutually agreed on child custody and visitation orders, a judge issues the DV-140 order after reviewing the filed DV-105, Request for Child Custody and Visitation Orders, and considering the evidence submitted by the parties in support of the request and other circumstances of the case. The order may be issued during a hearing, or, if the judge believes more appropriate, as part of the final order in a domestic violence case.
  
  Please note that we do not complete this form on your behalf. The official court order can only be prepared and issued by the judge/judicial officer assigned to your case. The judge/judicial officer will specify on this form which orders are granted or denied, any additional orders being made, and will sign the order form. However, our website will prepare a proposed order that you would like the judge to issue, which you can give to the court clerk alongside your DV-105. This proposed order helps streamline the process for the court in completing the form accurately.

template: dv_145_explanation
subject: |
  **DV-145,** Order to Prevent Child Abduction (*if you request child abduction prevention orders**)
content: |
  Form DV-145 is a court order designed to prevent the abduction of a child by a parent or guardian in domestic violence cases. This order states the specific restrictions and requirements placed on the parties involved to prevent child abduction and ensure the child's safety and well-being.

  A judge issues the DV-145 order after evaluating the risk of child abduction described in your filed DV-108, Request for Orders to Prevent Child Abduction, and considering the relevant evidence and factors in the case. This order may be issued during a hearing or as part of the final judgment in a domestic violence case.
  
  Please note that we do not complete this form on your behalf. The official court order can only be prepared and issued by the judge/judicial officer assigned to your case. The judge/judicial officer will specify on this form which orders are granted or denied, any additional orders being made, and will sign the order form.

template: dv_150_explanation
subject: |
  **DV-150,** Supervised Visitation and Exchange Order (*if you request supervised visitation orders**)
content: |
  Form DV-150 is a court order that states the terms and conditions for supervised visitation and how child exchanges will be conducted in domestic violence cases. This order ensures to the extent possible the child's safety during visitations and exchanges by requiring a neutral third party to supervise and monitor these interactions.
  
  A judge issues the DV-150 order after considering the supervised visitation orders requested in form DV-105 (if applicable) and the circumstances of the case, and determining that such an order is necessary to protect the child's best interests. Note that the judge may order that visitation be supervised if he or she determines it is in the best interest of your children, even if you do not explicitly request this type of order. The order may be issued during a hearing or as part of the final judgment in a domestic violence case.
  
  Please note that we do not complete this form on your behalf. The official court order can only be prepared and issued by the judge/judicial officer assigned to your case. The judge/judicial officer will specify on this form which orders are granted or denied, any additional orders being made, and will sign the order form.

This proposed order helps streamline the process for the court in completing the form accurately.

template: what_is_mediation
subject: |
  What is Custody/Visitation Mediation?
content: |
  California courts offer custody/visitation mediation to help parents develop a parenting plan when seeking child custody and visitation orders. A court mediator, who is a trained mental health professional, will assist you in this process.

  Mediators focus on the best interests of the children and have knowledge about child development, family dynamics, separation, divorce, and trauma. They are trained to understand domestic violence and create safe plans for the family.
---
template: mediation_confidentiality
subject: |
  Can I speak to the mediator privately? 
content: |
  If you are concerned about your or your children's safety, inform the mediator. You can request to speak with the mediator privately, out of the presence of the other party. Because you are requesting a domestic violence restraining order against your child or children's other parent, you have the right to meet separately with the mediator. You can also bring a support person to the mediation and mediation orientation.

  Keep in mind that mediators may share information with the other parent, and if they suspect child abuse, they must report it. Discuss privacy and confidentiality concerns with the mediator.

template: mediation_topics
subject: |
  Mediators help parents create a parenting plan focused on the best interests of children
content: |
  Mediators help parents create a parenting plan that addresses child custody, visitation (parenting time), and safety measures for domestic violence restraining order cases.
  
  We will provide you with further details later in this interview, but in short, child custody has two types: 
  
  1. Physical custody (where the child lives and the time spent with each parenty), and 
  2. Legal custody (decision-making rights that generally pertain to the child's health, education, and welfare). 
  
  Parents can share custody (joint custody), one parent can have primary custody (i.e. notably more time than the other parent), or one parent can have sole custody. The judge determines custody based on the child's best interests.

  Parenting plans can include safe visitation methods, conflict resolution strategies, and secure drop-off/pick-up locations. Note however, that there are limitations to what can be discussed in mediation. Mediation only covers child custody and parenting time, not child support or spousal support.

  You are not required to, but if you and the Other Party can reach an agreement on custody and visitation, the judge will review and most likely approve the agreement, unless the judge finds that it is not in the best interests of the child(ren). If you do not have a mutual agreement, the judge will make custody and visitation orders based on the evidence submitted by both parents, and any other circumstances that the judge believes relevant so that the best interests of the child(ren) are maintained.

template: mediation_orientation

  Attending mediation orientation
content: |
  Before mediation, attend an orientation to understand the process. Each court has different orientation types (online or in-person), so check your court's website for Family Court Services programs.

question: |
  Custody Mediation in DVRO Cases 
subquestion: |
  This interview will both educate you on the basics of child custody and visitation orders and help you prepare your court forms. That said, before or after you complete your forms regarding your preferred child custody and visitation orders, you may be ordered to attend custody/visitation mediation.

  The Court requires that you include an address on your forms where you can receive mail regarding the case you are filing, such as a friend or relative's address or P.O. box. **This address does not have to be the place where you live.** Court documents and court files are public record and whatever address is included on your forms will be seen by the other party and anyone else who looks at the Court file.

template: step_children_explanation
subject: "I have stepchildren, but I am not their adoptive parent or legal guardian. Why can't I use U Do It Legal to request custody and visitation orders for my stepchildren?"
content: |
  Contrary to what many assume, being a stepparent does not automatically make you a legal guardian or parent under the law. Even if you marry one of the parents of a child, the rights over the child remain with both natural parents after a separation or divorce and only are granted to a stepparent if a court order has been issued granting the stepparent custodial rights. 
  
  If you intend to seek custody and visitation orders for stepchildren that you have not formally adopted or over whom you have not been granted custodial rights, we highly encourage you to seek legal advice from an attorney.

  - Any children you have legally adopted with ${resp.name.first} who are under 18.
  - Any children over whom you have legal guardianship with ${resp.name.first} who are under 18. 
  
  In other words, to request custody and visitation orders over a minor child **in this case** using U Do It Legal, you and ${resp.name.first} **must both be a parent (biological or adoptive) or legal guardian** to that child. 
  
  This does not include:
  
  - Any of your children ages 18 or older.
  - Any of your children or any minor children under your care whose other parent or legal guardian is not ${resp.name.first}.
  - Any of ${resp.name.first}'s children or any minor children under their care whose other parent or legal guardian is not you.
  
  In other words, you cannot request child custody and visitastion orders over any minor child to whom you and ${resp.name.first} are not both a parent (biological or adoptive) or legal guardian using U Do It Legal.

  U Do It Legal's Limitations
subquestion: |
  Unfortunately, U Do It Legal cannot help you request custody and visitation orders for any children who do not meet the criteria written on the previous page. It is extremely difficult to meet the court's standard to award custody of a child to someone who is not a that child's parent or legal guardian *over* a parent or legal guardian, and U Do It Legal is not equipped to handle such matters.

  We recommend that you find a low-cost attorney through your local bar association, the state Bar of California at [this website](http://calbar.ca.gov), or through the Lawyer Referral Service at 1-866-442-2529.
  
  If you believe this is a mistake, please return to the previous page and review or correct your responses. If you cannot proceed with this interview because the child(ren) over which you wanted to request custody and visitation orders do not meet the criteria on the previous page, you may exit this interview and return to the UDIL Member Homepage.

  **Requesting Orders:** Child Custody and Visitation
subquestion: |
  The next few pages contain general information regarding child custody and visitation orders and how to request them in California. 
  
  We encourage parents to read through this information regardless of whether they are requesting custody and visitation orders.
continue button field: cc_intro

question: |
  **Requesting Orders:** Child Custody and Visitation
subquestion: |
  Separated parents with minor children need to either agree between themselves how and when each parent will spend time with their children (this is physical custody and visitation) and how decisions will be made for their children (this is legal custody), or have a court decide those issues for them. This is the essence of child custody and visitation. The following pages provide a general overview of child custody and visitation, and the possible orders that can be requested. At a basic level:

  - **Child Custody** refers to the rights and responsibilities between parents as it relates to their children.
  - **Visitation** (aka parenting time) refers to how and when each parent will spend time with their children.
  
  Courts often refer to child custody and visitation collectively as the “parenting plan.” Courts encourage parents to agree between themselves the details of a parenting plan for their children. However, when parents who are involved in court proceedings that concern the custody of minor children cannot mutually agree on a parenting plan, then the court will step in and make orders on the parenting plan to be followed.
  
  **Helpful Resources**
  
  For an overview of the child custody and visitation process and what terms common to that process mean, please read the [Child Custody Information Sheet](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl314info.pdf).
  
  We also highly encourage you to review the California Court System's [Families Change Website](https://www.familieschange.ca.gov/), which offers a [free course](https://pas.familieschange.ca.gov/en/course/25-parenting-plan) that helps parents, teens, and children deal with a family break up. You will find links to services that can help you and other types of resources.

question: |
  **Types of Custody:** What is Legal Custody?
subquestion: |
  There are two different types of custody: **legal** and **physical**. 
  
  **Legal Custody:** pertains to who makes important, long-term decisions about a child’s health, education, and welfare in matters such as: 
  
  * Where will the child go to school? 
  * Who will be the child’s doctor? 
  * Should the child undergo any special or emergency medical or mental health treatment? 
  * What religion should the child practice (if any)? 
  * In which extracurricular or enrichment activities should the child participate? 
  
  As a parent, you can request sole or joint legal custody orders: 
  
    - **Joint Legal Custody:** Both parents make these decisions. Defined by [California Family Code section 3003](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&sectionNum=3003). 
  
    - **Sole Legal Custody:** One parent makes these decisions. Defined by [California Family Code section 3006](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=3006.&nodeTreePath=10.1.1&lawCode=FAM).
   
   Joint legal custody is most commonly awarded in cases unless the court finds one parent is unfit or incapable of making these decisions. The court makes its determination of custody based on what is best in the best interest of the child—NOT the parents.
   
  ${card_start("Note:", color="info")}
  Joint legal custody is most often viewed as inappropriate for cases in which domestic violence, substance abuse, or child neglect by a parent is present.

question: |
  **Types of Custody:** What is Physical Custody?
subquestion: |
  Again, there are two different types of custody: **legal** and **physical**. 
  
  **Physical Custody:** pertains to with whom the children live. 
  
  As a parent, you can request sole, joint, or primary physical custody orders: 
  
    - **Sole Physical Custody:** The children live in one parent’s household. Defined by California Family Code section 3007. 
    
    - **Joint Physical Custody:** The children spend significant periods of time with both parents, generally living in both parents' households and alternating homes based on an agreed upon or court ordered schedule. Defined by California Family Code section 3004.  
  
    - **Primary Physical Custody:** The children spend time with both parents', but the children spend  significantly more time with one parent (for example: the children living with one parent during the school year and the other parent during summer vacation would be a situation where the school year parent has primary physical custody).
  
  ${card_start("Note:", color="info")}
  Joint physical custody arrangements are typically inappropriate for cases in which domestic violence, substance abuse, or child neglect by a parent is present.
  ${card_end()}

question: |
  **Types of Custody:** Physical Custody vs. Visitation
subquestion: | 
  Please note the difference between physical custody and visitation. Physical custody pertains to whether a child lives solely with one parent or spends varying periods of time with both parents, whereas visitation pertains to the specific days and times that the child(ren) spend with each parent. 
   
  For example, if you request sole physical custody of your child, this means that you are requesting that your child live in your household--NOT that they do not spend any time with ${resp.name.first}.

The schedule may specifythe days and times the parents will see the children; how weekends, holidays, and vacations will be shared; how transportation of the children between parents will be shared; the locations of visitation exchanges; limitations on travel, and other details. A specific schedule is preferred. If you request visitation according to a schedule for ${resp.name.first}, you may also request that it be supervised. 
---
template: supervised_visitation_explanation
subject: |
  Supervised Visitation According to a Schedule
content: |
  This type of visitation is most often ordered when a parent is determined to present a risk to the children’s safety or well-being, warranting the presence of a third party to supervise visits with the other parent. This form of visitation may also be mutually agreed upon. The supervisor can be you, another adult (such as a friend or relative), or a professional monitor. Supervised visitation is also used in reunification situations—where a parent and the children have not seen each other for quite some time, or some other circumstance has occurred which caused the children and a parent to not see each other for a significant period of time. In this instance, reunification is designed to re-introduce the parent and children with the assistance of the supervisor.
  
  Note that if you requestes a stay-away order, you can ask the court to grant an exception to the stay-away order for brief and peaceful contact during ${resp.name.first}'s court-ordered visitation with the children (if applicable).

  Reasonable Visitation 
content: |
  This type of visitation is not per a specific schedule, but is left open-ended for the parents to resolve between themselves once visitation is ordered by the court.

Reasonable visitation plans are often suited for parents with an amicable relationship (the parents get along), who communicate well with one another, and trust that they will cooperate with each other on when each will see the children This type of visitation arrangement becomes problematic if you and the other parent cannot agree on when visitation will occur after reasonable visitation is ordered.

  Family Code section 3044
content: |
  [Family Code 3044](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&sectionNum=3044.) states that a judicial finding of domestic violence against a parent (i.e., when a judge grants a permanent domestic violence restraining order or a parent is convicted of criminal domestic violence charges) creates a rebuttable presumption against ordering joint custody between parents, where one of the parents is the abuser, and against granting sole physical or legal custody to the abusing parent.
  
  In other words, if a parent is convicted or found by a court to have committed domestic violence for an incident that happened in the last five years, then the court will presume that the abusive parent **should not be awarded joint (or sole) legal and physical custody of a child**, and will require the abusive parent to prove to the court otherwise based on the law that governs these situations. 
---
template: famcode3044_explanation2
subject: |
  How does this (see info box above) apply to your situation?
content: |
  If the court grants your domestic violence restraining order against ${resp.name.first}, there will be a presumption that shared custody is not in the best interest of your children as well that ${resp.name.first} should not have sole physical or legal custody of the children. If ${resp.name.first} cannot overcome the presumption against him or her having joint or sole legal and physical custody of your children, the court will typically grant the other parent (in this case, you) sole legal and physical custody of the child, with ${resp.name.first} having some form of visitation, which may include supervised visitation. 
  
  Additionally, **if the judge grants your DVRO and gives any custody or unsupervised visits to ${resp.name.first}, the judge must clearly explain the reasons for doing so.**

  [California Penal Code Section 278.7](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=278.7.&lawCode=PEN) States:
  
  278.7. Exception; belief of bodily injury or emotional harm; report by person taking or concealing child; confidentiality
  
  - (a) Section 278.5 does not apply to a person with a right to custody of a child who, with a good faith and reasonable belief that the child, if left with the other parent, will suffer immediate bodily injury or emotional harm, takes, entices away, keeps, withholds, or conceals that child.
  - (b) Section 278.5 does not apply to a person with a right to custody of a child who has been a victim of domestic violence who, with a good faith and reasonable belief that the child, if left with the other person, will suffer immediate bodily injury or emotional harm, takes, entices away, keeps, withholds, or conceals that child. “Emotional harm” includes having a parent who has committed domestic violence against the parent who is taking, enticing away, keeping, withholding, or concealing the child.
  - (c) The person who takes, entices away, keeps, withholds, or conceals a child shall do all of the following: (1) Within a reasonable time from the taking, enticing away, keeping, withholding, or concealing, make a report to the office of the district attorney of the county where the child resided before the action. The report shall include the name of the person, the current address and telephone number of the child and the person, and the reasons the child was taken, enticed away, kept, withheld, or concealed. (2) Within a reasonable time from the taking, enticing away, keeping, withholding, or concealing, commence a custody proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (Section 1738A, Title 28, United States Code) or the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (Part 3 (commencing with Section 3400) of Division 8 of the Family Code). (3) Inform the district attorney’s office of any change of address or telephone number of the person and the child.
  - (d) For the purposes of this article, a reasonable time within which to make a report to the district attorney’s office is at least 10 days and a reasonable time to commence a custody proceeding is at least 30 days. This section shall not preclude a person from making a report to the district attorney’s office or commencing a custody proceeding earlier than those specified times.
  - (e) The address and telephone number of the person and the child provided pursuant to this section shall remain confidential unless released pursuant to state law or by a court order that contains appropriate safeguards to ensure the safety of the person and the child.

  What does this mean in more simple terms? 
content: |
  This law states that if you satisfy the criteria under Penal Code section 278.7, you are allowed to take or conceal the children for purposes of protecting  the child. This exemption applies to victims of domestic violence.

  **However, if you take or hide a child under these circumstances, you are required to do the following:**

  - Report to the district attorney's office in the county where the child lived before you took or concealed them. You should do this within a reasonable time, sharing your name, the child's current address and phone number, and your reasons for taking or hiding the child.
  - Start a legal process to obtain custody of the child, such as requesting custody and visitation orders through your request for domestic violence restraining orders. You should do this in a court that has the right jurisdiction and is in line with federal law, such as the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act or the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. This should be done within a reasonable time from when you took or hid the child.
  - Keep the district attorney's office updated with any changes in your address or phone number, as well as the child's.

  Under section 278.7, a "reasonable time" to report to the district attorney's office is considered to be at least 10 days. A "reasonable time" to start a custody proceeding is at least 30 days. However, you can choose to do these things sooner.

  Lastly, your address and phone number, and the child's, that you provided during this process will stay confidential. It can only be disclosed according to state law or by a court order that has necessary safeguards to protect your and the child's safety.

question: |
  **Child Custody and Visitation:** Children's Addresses
subquestion: |
  Because you indicated that your children have not all lived together for the past 5 years, you must prepare form DV-105(A): City and State Where Children Lived. At the end of this interview, a blank DV-105(A) will be available for you to download with your completed child custody and visitation forms. 
  
  This form asks you provide the court with each child's residential history over past 5 years. Additionally, the form only has space for 2 residential histories, so if you have more than 2 children with different residential histories, you will need to prepare another DV-105(A) until you have listed the residential histories for all your children over the past 5 years. Because of all this, our software cannot automatically prepare this form for you.
  
  That said, we do not expect you to memorize all of this information right now, so we have attached simple instructions to the blank DV-105(A) to help you complete it. If you need further assistance in this regard, please watch the Form Review video in your next interview, Part 4: Next Steps and Hearing Preparation, or take a look at our Sample Pleadings.

question: |
  **Requesting Orders:** Visitation 
subquestion: |
  You can ask a judge to make decisions about when your child spends time with ${resp.name.first}. This is called parenting time or visitation. It means the schedule and exact times each parent spends with the child. If a parent does not get custody, that parent can have parenting time with the child if a judge believes it is safe and in the child’s best interest. Answer the questions below to tell the judge what parenting time you want right now for ${resp.name.first}. Any orders the judge makes are temporary for now. They last until the court date (about three weeks away, after filing). On your court date, the judge can change or extend the orders.

template: sv_explanation

  As a Reminder: What is supervised visitation?
content: |
  Remember, supervised visitation requires that a parent's visitation with the children is monitored by another person. This is usually ordered by a court when one parent might be a danger to the children's safety or well-being. The person doing the monitoring could be someone the family knows, like a friend or relative, or it could be a professional monitor. Sometimes, the court orders supervised visits in reunification situations (i.e., when a parent has not seen their kids for a long time and needs help getting back in touch with them).
  
  Keep in mind, supervised visitation might not go on forever. If ${resp.name.first} does what's required or if the court thinks he or she no longer presents a danger to the children, ${resp.name.first} may get more time with the children, maybe even overnight visits. If overnight visits are allowed, the supervision will stop.

template: prof_sv_explanation
subject: |
  Professional Supervisors
content: |
  A professional supervision provider is a person who has special training and has passed a background check. They charge money for their services. Additionally, because they are mandated reporters, professional providers have to tell the local child welfare department (Child Protective Services, or "CPS") if they suspect that a child is being abused. Professional providers can be used for visits that are only a short time, like one or two hours. If you request a professional supervisor, you will need to think about who will pay for the supervisor. It's important to know that you might have to pay some of the supervisor's costs too.
---
template: nonprof_sv_explanation
subject: |
  Non-Profesional Supervisors
content: |
  A nonprofessional supervision provider is usually someone the family knows, like a friend or relative, who does not have special training. If it would be dangerous for your child to be alone with the other parent, this may not be the best option.
---
template: prov_vs_nonprof_explanation
subject: |
  Should I ask for a professional or non-professional supervisor?
content: |
  Professional providers have special rules and training to handle situations that might be dangerous, like domestic violence or child abduction (kidnapping). Nonprofessional providers do not have this training or experience. Sometimes, using a professional provider is not possible because of costs or language barriers.
---
template: sv_visitation_duration_explanation
subject: |
  How long and how often should visits be? 
content: |
  This will depend on the age and needs of your children, your and ${resp.name.first}'s work schedules, and the availability of the supervision provider. Your visitation schedule should focus on what you think will be best for your children, NOT what would be best for you or ${resp.name.first}. 
---
template: sv_transportation_explanation
subject: |
  Who should take the children to and from the visit?
content: |  
  You can ask someone you trust to bring your children to and from the visits. The person who drives the children must have a driver's license and car insurance. If you do not have anyone to help you with driving, professional providers have rules in place to keep both parents safe during visitation exchanges.

  To use the visitation schedule template, simply check the box next to each day you want ${resp.name.first} to have a supervised visit. Then, respond to the fields that appear. If there's a field you do not want to answer, you may leave it blank.

  You can be as detailed or as general as you want when making your visitation schedule. But keep in mind, if your schedule is not specific, it might be hard for the court to enforce it. Including information like the exact days, dates, times for visits, where the visits will happen, and where the kids will be dropped off and picked up will make your order more enforceable.

  **Requesting Orders:** Unsupervised Visitation Schedule
subquestion: |
  You've indicated that you would like to use the template below to request a visitation schedule. 
  
  *If this is incorrect, please go back and uncheck the box labelled: "Check here if you want to use the chart pictured to create a visitation schedule."*
  
  [FILE unsupervised_visitation_image, 100%]
  
  To use the visitation schedule template, simply check the box next to each day you want ${resp.name.first} to have an unsupervised visit. Then, respond to the fields that appear. If there's a field you do not want to answer, you may leave it blank.

  You can be as detailed or as general as you want when making your visitation schedule. But keep in mind, if your schedule is not specific, it might be hard for the court to enforce it. Including information like the exact days, dates, times for visits, where the visits will happen, and where the kids will be dropped off and picked up will make your order more enforceable.

However, you may download the proposed order that you would like the judge to issue below, which you can give to the court clerk alongside your DV-105. This proposed order helps streamline the process for the court in completing the form accurately.

  As a reminder, if you have fled, or if you plan on fleeing, your home with the children without the Other Party’s written consent or a child custody order permitting you to do so, you must file a Good Cause Report with the District Attorney's Office in both the county where you lived with the children and the county to which you have fled with the children within 10 days of taking the children. If you do not do so, you may be charged with child abduction (kidnapping).

  - Complete interview **Part 4: Next Steps** once you are finished with each applicable interview in Part 3. If you are not requesting any child support, spousal support, child custody and visitation, or lawyer's fees and costs orders, skip straight to this interview. 
  - Complete interview **Part 4.1: Request to Reschedule Hearing** before the scheduled hearing (the hearing will be scheduled when you file all your court forms with the court clerk) if you need to request that the court postpone/reschedule the hearing for good cause.
